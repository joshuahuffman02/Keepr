# Questions

We need the following details before implementing Phase 1 (Pricing & Payments):

1. What product/app is this for, and what is the core user flow?
2. What pricing model is required (subscription, one-time, tiered, usage-based, hybrid)?
3. Which payment provider must be used (Stripe, Paddle, Apple IAP, etc.)?
4. What regions/currencies/tax handling requirements exist?
5. Who are the users (B2B campground owners, consumers, admins, etc.)?
6. What platforms are in scope (web only, iOS only, both)?
7. What auth requirements and roles are needed?
