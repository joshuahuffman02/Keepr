# Camp Everyday Host - Business Plan
## Bootstrapped Growth Strategy for a Time-Constrained Founder

---

## Executive Summary

Camp Everyday Host is a campground management platform competing with Campspot, Newbook, and Firefly. Unlike VC-backed competitors burning cash for market share, we're building a profitable, sustainable business that can grow without requiring full-time founder involvement.

**Key Constraint:** Founder has a full-time job, family (3 kids), and two campgrounds to manage. The business must be designed to run with minimal active management.

**Business Model:** SaaS + per-booking fees
- Standard: $69/month + $2.50/booking
- Early access pricing for first 45 campgrounds (locked rates forever)

**Target:** Profitable lifestyle business generating $200-500k/year within 3-5 years with minimal founder time investment (5-10 hours/week).

## Time Reality Check

### Founder's Available Time

| Commitment | Hours/Week |
|------------|------------|
| Full-time job | 40-50 |
| Family (3 kids) | 20-30 |
| Two campgrounds | 10-20 |
| Sleep, life, sanity | 50+ |
| **Available for Camp Everyday** | **5-10 hours** |

### What 5-10 Hours/Week Can Realistically Do

- Answer support tickets (if minimal)
- Review key metrics
- Make critical decisions
- Occasional customer calls
- NOT: Active sales, marketing campaigns, feature development, bug fixes

**Implication:** The business MUST be designed to run itself. Every hour of founder time should be spent on leverage activities, not maintenance.

## Core Strategy: Product-Led Growth

### The Product Must Sell Itself

With limited time, traditional sales (cold calls, demos, follow-ups) isn't viable. The product must:

1. **Be discoverable** - SEO, word of mouth, marketplace presence
2. **Convert without a salesperson** - Clear pricing, self-service signup, free trial
3. **Onboard without hand-holding** - Great UX, documentation, automated setup
4. **Retain without account management** - Reliable product, self-service support

### Automation Requirements

| Function | Automation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|
| Sales | Self-service signup, no demos required |
| Onboarding | Automated setup wizard, data import tools |
| Support | Knowledge base, AI chatbot, community forum |
| Billing | Stripe handles everything |
| Marketing | Content SEO, referral program (word of mouth) |

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Early Access (First 45 Campgrounds)

| Tier | Spots | Monthly | Per Booking | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Founder's Circle | 5 | $0 forever | $0.75 | Testimonials, case studies, product feedback |
| Pioneer | 15 | $0 for 12mo | $1.00 | Early traction, word of mouth |
| Trailblazer | 25 | $14.50 for 6mo | $1.25 | Volume, prove product-market fit |

### Standard Pricing (After Early Access)

- **$69/month + $2.50/booking**
- All features included (no tiered complexity)
- AI features included
- No marketplace commission (unlike Campspot's 10%)

### Why This Works for Bootstrapping

- Recurring revenue (monthly) provides stability
- Per-booking fees scale with customer success
- No enterprise sales cycles requiring founder time
- Simple pricing = no negotiation needed

## Financial Projections

### Conservative Estimates

| Year | Campgrounds | Monthly Revenue | Monthly Costs | Monthly Profit | Annual Profit |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | 100 | $12,000 | $4,000 | $8,000 | $96,000 |
| 2 | 350 | $40,000 | $15,000 | $25,000 | $300,000 |

### Key Assumptions
- 50 bookings/campground/month average
- 5% monthly churn (lose 5% of customers each month)
- Team costs scale with growth
- No VC funding, all growth from revenue

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Not Enough Time

**Mitigation:**
- Hire support help early (even at cost of profit)
- Build self-service everything
- Say no to custom requests that require founder time
- Accept slower growth in exchange for sustainability

### Risk: Competitor Pressure

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on underserved segment (small-medium parks)
- Compete on simplicity and service, not features
- Build switching costs through data and integrations
- Stay profitable (competitors burning cash will eventually struggle)

### Risk: Technical Issues

**Mitigation:**
- Keep architecture simple
- Use managed services (Railway, Vercel) to reduce ops burden
- Hire part-time developer by month 6-12
- Build monitoring and alerts to catch issues early

### Risk: Customer Support Overload

**Mitigation:**
- Invest heavily in documentation and knowledge base
- AI chatbot for common questions
- Community forum for peer support
- Hire support help before you're overwhelmed
