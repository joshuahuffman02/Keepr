# Phase 5: Finalization & UX polish

## Goals
- Improve UX polish, performance, and accessibility.
- Finalize onboarding, empty states, and error handling.
- Complete production readiness documentation.

## Non-goals
- New core product features (should be complete by Phase 4).
- Major architectural rewrites.
- Unscoped design experiments.

## Acceptance criteria (testable)
- Performance budgets meet documented targets.
- Accessibility checks pass for key flows.
- Support/runbook documentation is complete.
- Lint, typecheck, unit tests, and smoke checks pass.

## Open questions
- Which UX areas are highest priority for polish?
- What performance budgets are required?
- What accessibility level is targeted (WCAG AA/AAA)?
