Focus on providing value. Mention Keepr naturally only 1-2 times per post as a helpful solution, not a sales pitch.

### 2. Use Real Examples

Include specific scenarios campground owners face. Make it relatable.

### 3. Make It Actionable

Every post should give readers something they can implement today.

### 4. Include Internal Linking Placeholders

Mark where posts should link to each other: `[LINK: related-post-title]`

### 5. SEO Best Practices

- Target keyword in title, first paragraph, and 2-3 times in body
- Use semantic variations of keywords
- Include questions people actually search for
- Use H2/H3 headers with keywords

### 6. Suggested CTAs

**For owner-focused posts:**

> "Want to simplify your campground operations? See how Keepr can help."

**For camper-focused posts:**

> "Find your next campsite at campreserv.com"
