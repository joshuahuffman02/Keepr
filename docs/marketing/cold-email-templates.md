# Cold Email Templates for Campground Outreach

## Overview

These templates are designed for cold outreach to campground owners and operators. Personalize each email with specific details about their park.

## Template 1: The Soft Problem Opener

**Best for:** First touch, unknown pain point

**Subject Lines (test all):**

- Question about [Park Name]'s reservation system
- Quick question from a fellow camping enthusiast
- Noticed [Park Name] on my trip planning

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I came across [Park Name] while [researching campgrounds in [Region] / planning a trip to [Area] / browsing [directory]].

Quick question: Are you happy with your current reservation software, or is it one of those things that works "well enough" but doesn't thrill you?

I ask because we built Keepr specifically for parks like yours, and I'm curious if the problems we solve resonate:

- Setup fees that cost more than a month's revenue
- Per-booking fees that grow as you grow
- Features designed for 500-site resorts, not [their actual size]-site campgrounds

If any of that sounds familiar, I'd love to show you what we're doing differently.

If you're all set, no worries at all. Happy to share some tips for [relevant topic based on their park] regardless.

[Your name]
Keepr

P.S. - We include AI pricing features that most competitors charge extra for. Might be interesting if you're doing rate adjustments manually now.

## Template 2: The Competitor-Specific Approach

**Best for:** When you know they use Campspot/Newbook/etc.

**Subject Lines:**

- Alternative to [Competitor] for [Park Name]
- Question about your [Competitor] costs
- Parks switching from [Competitor] - curious if you've considered it

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Park Name] uses [Competitor] for reservations. [How you noticed - Campspot badge on site, saw at trade show, etc.]

A few parks that switched to us from [Competitor] said the same things:

"We were paying $X,XXX/year in per-booking fees alone."
"Setup took 6 weeks and cost $X,XXX."
"We needed features they wanted to upsell us on."

So we built Keepr to fix those:

- $100/month + $2.30/booking (transparent, predictable)
- No setup fees, live in days not weeks
- AI pricing and forecasting included, not extra

Would it be worth 15 minutes to see if the math works out better for [Park Name]?

Either way, happy to answer any questions about the switch process. We've helped [X] parks migrate and it's smoother than you'd expect.

P.S. - Here's a quick comparison if you want the numbers: [link to /compare/campspot]

## Template 3: The Specific Pain Point

**Best for:** When you see evidence of a specific problem (old website, no online booking, etc.)

**Subject Lines:**

- Mobile booking for [Park Name]?
- Quick thought on [Park Name]'s booking process
- [Park Name] - spotted something that might help

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I was checking out [Park Name]'s website to potentially plan a trip, and noticed [specific observation]:

[Choose one:]
- Your booking process sends visitors to call or email. Are you looking to add online booking?
- The site looks great but booking requires a phone call. Have you considered a reservation system?
- I saw you're using [dated system] - are you exploring newer options?

I run Keepr, campground software built for mid-size parks that want modern features without enterprise prices.

Parks like [Park Name] typically save 15-20 hours/week on phone bookings once guests can self-serve online. And they pick up bookings at 10pm that would've been lost to "I'll call tomorrow" (they never do).

If you're happy with how things work, I get it. But if you've been thinking about modernizing, I'd be glad to show you what's possible.

Takes 15 minutes and there's no pressure.

[Your name]

## Template 4: The Industry News Hook

**Best for:** Referencing recent industry trends, competitor news, etc.

**Subject Lines:**

- [Industry news topic] - thought of [Park Name]
- After [event/news], had a question for you
- [Recent trend] affecting parks like yours?

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Just read about [industry news: competitor price increase, industry report, new regulation, etc.] and thought of [Park Name].

[Relevant observation about how the news might affect them]

We've been talking with a lot of parks about [related topic], and it made me wonder:

Are you evaluating your tech stack this year? Many parks are finding that [competitor] costs have crept up 20-30% over the past few years, and they're exploring alternatives.

Keepr is what we built for parks that want:
- Transparent pricing that doesn't grow faster than your bookings
- Modern features without enterprise complexity
- A team that actually answers the phone

If this is on your radar, I'd love 15 minutes to show you what we're doing.

If not, no problem. I just share relevant industry stuff sometimes if you're interested.

[Your name]

## Template 5: The Follow-Up (After No Response)

**Best for:** 5-7 days after first email, no response

**Subject Lines:**

- Following up - [original subject]
- Quick follow up on Keepr
- [First Name] - worth another look?

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I reached out last week about Keepr and wanted to follow up.

I know campground season is [busy/winding down/ramping up] so I'll keep this short:

One thing I didn't mention: we include AI-powered demand forecasting and dynamic pricing suggestions. Parks using it typically see 15-20% revenue lift.

Most competitors charge $100-200/month extra for AI features. We include it in the base price.

If you've got 15 minutes this week, I'd love to show you how it works.

If you're all set with your current system, just let me know and I'll stop following up.

[Your name]

P.S. - Happy to send a comparison with whatever you're using now if you share the name. No sales pitch, just the numbers.
```

## Template 6: The Breakup Email

**Best for:** Final follow-up after 2-3 attempts

**Subject Lines:**

- Should I close your file?
- Last question about [Park Name]
- Signing off (unless...)

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a couple times about Keepr and haven't heard back.

I get it, you're busy running a campground and software sales emails aren't exactly exciting.

I'll stop emailing unless you tell me otherwise. But before I do:

Is there a better time to revisit this? Many parks find that:
- Post-season is a good time to evaluate new systems
- Pre-season (Jan/Feb) is when they want to have new tools ready
- After a particularly frustrating day with their current system

Just reply with "try me in [month]" and I'll set a reminder.

Or if you're happy with your setup, no problem at all. I appreciate you running a great park.

Best,
[Your name]
```
