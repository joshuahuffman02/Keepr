## Comment Templates

### Template 1: Answering "What software should I use?"

**Trigger:** Posts asking for campground/RV park software recommendations

```
Great question. I've worked with a lot of campground software (I'm in the industry), so here's my honest take:

**For large parks (150+ sites):**
Campspot or Newbook are the established players. Expect $400-600+/month plus per-booking fees. They work, but you're paying premium prices.

**For mid-size parks (50-150 sites):**
This is where it gets tricky. The enterprise tools are overkill, but the small-business tools lack features. Keepr (disclosure: I work on this) built specifically for this segment at $100/month + $2.30/booking.

**For small parks (under 50 sites):**
Some parks still do fine with simple booking plugins or even Google Calendar + spreadsheets. It depends on your booking volume.

What size is your operation? Happy to give more specific thoughts.
```

### Template 2: Answering "Is [Competitor] worth it?"

**Trigger:** Posts asking about Campspot, Newbook, etc.

```
I'm in the campground software space, so take this with appropriate grain of salt:

[Competitor] is a solid product. Here's who it works well for:
- Large multi-property operations
- Parks that want marketplace exposure
- Operations with dedicated admin staff

Here's where it might not be ideal:
- Per-booking fees add up at scale ($2.50 x 200 bookings = $500/month extra)
- Setup fees and long contracts
- Complexity for smaller operations

If you're in the [relevant size range], there are alternatives worth considering. Happy to share what I know if you want to DM me your specifics.

What's your park size and current booking volume?
```

### Template 3: Operational Advice (No Product Mention)

**Trigger:** Questions about no-shows, pricing, operations

```
I've seen a lot of parks tackle this. Here's what works:

**For no-shows specifically:**

1. **Require deposits** - Even a 1-night non-refundable deposit drops no-shows 40-50%

2. **Automated reminders** - Send confirmation, 7-day reminder, 2-day reminder, and day-before message. SMS works better than email for the final reminders.

3. **Make cancellation EASY** - Counterintuitive, but if guests can easily cancel, they will. A canceled reservation can be resold. A no-show can't.

4. **Track your data** - Know your no-show rate by season, day of week, lead time. Patterns emerge.

One park I know went from 15% no-shows to under 4% with just deposits + automated reminders. That's basically free revenue recovery.

What's your current approach?
```

### Template 4: Pricing Strategy Help

**Trigger:** Questions about rates, pricing strategy, revenue

```
Dynamic pricing doesn't have to be complicated. Here's a simple framework:

**Base Rate:** What you'd charge on an average Tuesday

**Premium Tiers:**
- Friday/Saturday: +20-30%
- Holiday weekends: +40-60%
- Event weekends (local festival, etc.): +50-100%

**Discount Tiers:**
- Sunday-Thursday off-season: -10-20%
- Long stays (7+ nights): -10-15%
- Last-minute (within 3 days, if you have availability): variable

The key insight: You're already losing bookings on slow nights at your current rate. Dropping 15% might fill sites that would've been empty. And you're leaving money on the table on sold-out weekends.

Some parks use software that does this automatically. Others just build it into a rate calendar. Either works, but automated is less work.

What's your current pricing approach?
```

### Template 5: Software Comparison Question

**Trigger:** Direct comparison questions

```
I work in this space, so full disclosure there.

Here's my honest comparison:

**Campspot:**
Pros: Market presence, marketplace exposure, comprehensive features
Cons: Expensive ($2.50+/booking adds up), long setup, enterprise-focused

**Newbook:**
Pros: Solid features, good for multi-property
Cons: High setup fees ($1-3K), complex, enterprise pricing

**Keepr:**
Pros: $100/mo + $2.30/booking, AI included, fast setup
Cons: Newer (less market presence), smaller company

**For your situation specifically:**
[Tailor based on what they shared about their park]

Happy to answer specific questions. I try to be objective even though I'm biased toward what we're building.

### Template 6: Responding to Frustration with Current Software

**Trigger:** Venting about software problems

```
I feel your pain. Heard similar stories from a lot of parks.

A few thoughts:

1. **Document everything** - What specifically isn't working? Feature gaps vs bugs vs usability issues?

2. **Calculate your true cost** - Many parks are surprised when they add up base + per-booking + integrations + support upgrades

3. **Know your contract** - Check your renewal date and cancellation terms. Some vendors auto-renew with 90-day notice requirements.

4. **Data portability** - Ask your current vendor for a data export. Good systems let you export reservations, guest data, etc. If they make it hard, that's a red flag.

When does your current contract come up? Might be worth shopping around if you're in a renewal window.
```

### Template 7: Industry Trend Discussion

**Trigger:** Discussions about industry future, technology, etc.

```
Been thinking about this a lot. Here's my take:

**What's changing:**

1. Guest expectations are rising. They book everything else online with 2 clicks. Campgrounds need to match that.

2. AI is becoming table stakes. Dynamic pricing, demand forecasting, automated communication. Not "nice to have" anymore.

3. The mid-market is underserved. Enterprise software is expensive and complex. Simple tools lack features. Someone needs to build for the middle.

**What stays the same:**

- Location and quality of the experience still win
- Personal touch matters more in camping than in hotels
- Many guests still prefer a phone call (but fewer every year)

**What I'm less sure about:**

- How quickly OTA booking (like hotels) will penetrate camping
- Whether consolidation continues (PE buying parks)
- Impact of remote work on shoulder season demand

Curious what others are seeing on the ground?
```

### Template 8: Building in Public Post (r/SaaS, r/startups)

**Trigger:** Relevant threads, or posting original content

```
Quick update from building campground management software:

**This week:**
- Added AI demand forecasting (finally shipped!)
- Onboarded 3 new parks
- Heard "this is so much simpler than [competitor]" 4 times (feels good)

**What I learned:**
Campground owners are incredibly busy during season. Our best conversion window is Oct-Feb when they have time to breathe.

**Numbers:**
- X parks live
- $X MRR
- 97% retention (seasonal churn expected)

**Next up:**
Building OTA integration. It's a mess. Anyone built booking.com/Airbnb integrations before?

Ask me anything about building B2B for niche verticals.

## Sample Answers to Common Questions

### "Why is campground software so expensive?"

```
A few reasons from what I've seen:

1. **Small market** - There are ~27,000 campgrounds in the US. Compare that to millions of restaurants, stores, etc. Less volume = higher prices per customer.

2. **Complexity** - Campground operations are surprisingly complex: reservations, site assignments, utilities, POS, housekeeping, maintenance, guest communication. That's a lot of functionality.

3. **Switching costs** - Once you're on a system, migrating data is painful. Vendors know this and price accordingly.

4. **VC funding** - Some vendors have raised money and need to show returns. That money comes from customers.

That said, I think the market is overpriced. We're building Keepr specifically to offer more reasonable pricing ($100/mo + $2.30/booking). Not because features should be cheaper, but because we're more efficient at building them.
```

### "Is online booking worth it for a small campground?"

```
Depends on your definition of "worth it."

**The math:**

If you're getting 10+ phone calls per day for bookings:
- At 5 minutes per call = 50+ minutes/day
- At $20/hour opportunity cost = $17/day = $500+/month in your time

Compare that to software cost. Usually works out.

**Beyond the math:**

- You're losing bookings at 10pm when someone searches and can't book
- You're limiting yourself to local time zone availability
- Your staff is tied to the phone instead of improving guest experience

**When it might NOT be worth it:**

- Very small operations (under 10 sites)
- Heavy repeat clientele who know to call you
- Seasonal-only with limited booking windows

What's your current volume look like?
```

### "How do I get more bookings?"

```
From what I've seen, these move the needle:

**Quick wins:**

1. **Online booking** - If you're phone-only, you're losing people who search at night or don't want to call

2. **Google Business Profile** - Make sure it's claimed, photos are good, info is current. Tons of searches happen on Maps.

3. **Respond to reviews** - Even negative ones. Shows you care.

**Medium-term:**

4. **Dynamic pricing** - Lower slow-night rates to fill, raise weekend rates when you'd sell out anyway

5. **Email past guests** - Simple "we'd love to have you back" message works surprisingly well

6. **OTA listings** - RoverPass, Hipcamp, etc. They take a cut but bring new eyes

**Longer-term:**

7. **SEO** - Rank for "[your area] camping" and similar searches

8. **Content** - Blog about local activities, what to do around your park

9. **Loyalty program** - Give regulars a reason to come back

What's your biggest constraint right now - awareness or conversion?
