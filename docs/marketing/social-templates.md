### Template 1: Hot Take on Industry Problem

```
Unpopular opinion: Most campground software is overpriced for what it delivers.

Setup fees of $2,000+
Per-booking fees that grow faster than your business
"Enterprise features" you'll never use

We built Keepr because mid-size parks deserve modern software at fair prices.

$100/month + $2.30/booking
No setup fees
AI features included

That's it. No asterisks.

Anyone else tired of software costs eating into margins?
```

### Template 2: Data-Driven Insight

```
We analyzed 50,000 campground bookings.

Here's what surprised us:

1. 34% of bookings happen after 8pm (when most offices are closed)
2. Mobile bookings convert 23% better than desktop
3. Parks with automated reminders have 60% fewer no-shows
4. Dynamic pricing parks earn 18% more per site

The takeaway?

The campgrounds winning in 2025 aren't the ones with the best sites.

They're the ones with the best systems.

What's your biggest operational bottleneck right now?

### Template 3: Behind-the-Scenes Building Story

```
Why I'm building campground software:

3 years ago, I tried to book a campsite online.

The website looked like it was from 2005.
I had to call to check availability.
They faxed me a confirmation. (Faxed.)

I thought: "The camping industry deserves better tech."

So we built Keepr.

Modern booking. AI pricing. Staff scheduling. POS.
All in one system, priced fairly.

Parks shouldn't have to choose between outdated software and overpriced enterprise tools.

There's a middle ground, and we're building it.
```

### Template 4: Value-Add Educational Content

```
5 things every RV park should have in their software by 2025:

1. Mobile-first online booking
(73% of travel bookings happen on phones)

2. Dynamic pricing engine
(Static rates leave 15-20% on the table)

3. Utility metering integration
(Electric costs are climbing, pass them through fairly)

4. AI demand forecasting
(Know which weekends will sell out before they do)

5. Guest self-service portal
(Reduce front desk workload by 30%+)

How many does your current system have?
```

### Template 5: Customer Win Story (Anonymous if needed)

```
A 75-site RV park in [Region] switched to Keepr.

Before:
- Paying $1,400/month in software costs
- 3-week setup with their old provider
- AI features were $150/month extra

After:
- $270/month total (75 sites, ~75 bookings/month)
- Live in 5 days
- AI included

Annual savings: $13,560

The owner told me: "I wish I'd switched two years ago."

If you're curious what your numbers would look like, happy to run them.
```

### Template 6: Common Mistake / Problem Highlight

```
The most expensive mistake campground owners make:

Choosing software based on features they'll never use.

I've seen 50-site family campgrounds pay for:
- Multi-property management (they have 1 property)
- Enterprise reporting (they need 3 reports)
- API integrations (they don't know what an API is)

The result?
$500+/month for software they use 20% of.

Match your software to your operations.
Not to what you might need "someday."

What features are you paying for but not using?
```

---

### Template 7: Engagement/Poll

```
Quick poll for campground operators:

What's your biggest frustration with your current reservation software?

A) Too expensive
B) Too complicated
C) Missing features I need
D) Support is terrible
E) Actually, I'm happy with it

Drop your answer in the comments.
(I'm genuinely curious, not pitching anything)
```

---

### Template 8: Industry Trend Commentary

```
The campground software industry has a pricing problem.

10 years ago: Buy software once, own it forever
5 years ago: $200/month subscription
Today: $500/month + $2.50/booking + setup fees + training fees

Costs went up.
Value... stayed about the same.

This isn't sustainable.

Parks will start asking harder questions about what they're paying for.

The companies that answer honestly will win.
The ones that hide behind "call for pricing" will lose.

## Twitter/X Threads

### Thread 1: Why Campground Software is Overpriced

```
Tweet 1:
Campground software pricing is out of control.

A thread on why you're probably paying too much:

Tweet 2:
The average mid-size campground (100 sites) pays:
- $399/month base
- $625/month in per-booking fees
- $2,000 setup fee

That's $15,000+/year for software.

Tweet 3:
Where does that money go?

Some of it goes to:
- Servers
- Development
- Support

A lot of it goes to:
- VC investor returns
- Bloated sales teams
- Features you don't use

Tweet 4:
The problem: Most campground software was built for enterprise resorts.

Then they tried to sell the same thing to 50-site family campgrounds.

Same price. Same complexity. Same lock-in contracts.

Tweet 5:
Here's what fair pricing looks like:

$100/month base (covers operations)
$2/booking (aligns with your revenue)
$0 setup (it's cloud software, setup is automated)

That same 100-site park? $350/month instead of $1,000+.

Tweet 6:
We built @CampEveryday with this model.

Same features. Modern tech. AI included.
But priced for mid-size parks, not enterprise budgets.

If you're paying more than $10/site/month, you should ask why.
```

### Thread 2: What I Learned Building for Campgrounds

```
Tweet 1:
I've spent 2 years building campground software.

Here's what I learned about the industry that surprised me:

Tweet 2:
1. Campgrounds are WAY more sophisticated than people think.

We're not talking picnic tables and outhouses.

Modern RV parks manage utility billing, dynamic pricing, staff scheduling, POS systems, and guest loyalty programs.

Tweet 3:
2. The technology gap is massive.

Some parks are fully automated.
Others are still using paper ledgers and phone reservations.

The difference isn't budget. It's exposure to what's possible.

Tweet 4:
3. Switching software is terrifying for owners.

I get it. Your whole business runs on this system.

That's why vendors lock you into 3-year contracts. They know you're scared to leave.

Tweet 5:
4. Most parks are underpriced on peak weekends and overpriced on slow nights.

Dynamic pricing isn't about "surge pricing."

It's about matching rates to demand. More bookings. More revenue.

Tweet 6:
5. The best campgrounds treat tech as an investment, not an expense.

They see it as: How much time does this save? How much revenue does it generate?

The ROI math usually works out.

Tweet 7:
Building @CampEveryday has been the most interesting thing I've done.

If you run a campground and want to chat about tech, my DMs are open.

No pitch required. Just curious about your operations.
