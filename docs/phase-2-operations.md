# Phase 2: Operations

## Goals
- Define core operational workflows needed by staff/admins.
- Deliver task tracking or workflow management with clear status states.

- Document operational runbooks for support.

## Non-goals

- Advanced analytics dashboards (Phase 3).
- End-user marketing or growth features.

## Acceptance criteria (testable)
- Operational workflows are implemented with UI + API coverage.
- Role-based permissions prevent unauthorized access.
- Unit tests cover critical operational flows.
- Lint, typecheck, unit tests, and smoke checks pass.

## Open questions
- Which operational workflows are required first?
- What roles should have access to each workflow?
- Are there SLAs or reporting requirements for operations?
