# Keepr Host - Business Plan
## Bootstrapped Growth Strategy for a Time-Constrained Founder

---

## Executive Summary

Keepr Host is a campground management platform competing with Campspot, Newbook, and Firefly. Unlike VC-backed competitors burning cash for market share, we're building a profitable, sustainable business that can grow without requiring full-time founder involvement.

**Key Constraint:** Founder has a full-time job, family (3 kids), and two campgrounds to manage. The business must be designed to run with minimal active management.

**Business Model:** SaaS + per-booking fees
- Standard: $69/month + $2.50/booking
- Early access pricing for first 45 campgrounds (locked rates forever)

**Target:** Profitable lifestyle business generating $200-500k/year within 3-5 years with minimal founder time investment (5-10 hours/week).

---

## Time Reality Check

### Founder's Available Time

| Commitment | Hours/Week |
|------------|------------|
| Full-time job | 40-50 |
| Family (3 kids) | 20-30 |
| Two campgrounds | 10-20 |
| Sleep, life, sanity | 50+ |
| **Available for Keepr** | **5-10 hours** |

### What 5-10 Hours/Week Can Realistically Do

- Answer support tickets (if minimal)
- Review key metrics
- Make critical decisions
- Occasional customer calls
- NOT: Active sales, marketing campaigns, feature development, bug fixes

**Implication:** The business MUST be designed to run itself. Every hour of founder time should be spent on leverage activities, not maintenance.

---

## Core Strategy: Product-Led Growth

### The Product Must Sell Itself

With limited time, traditional sales (cold calls, demos, follow-ups) isn't viable. The product must:

1. **Be discoverable** - SEO, word of mouth, marketplace presence
2. **Convert without a salesperson** - Clear pricing, self-service signup, free trial
3. **Onboard without hand-holding** - Great UX, documentation, automated setup
4. **Retain without account management** - Reliable product, self-service support

### Automation Requirements

| Function | Automation Needed |
|----------|-------------------|
| Sales | Self-service signup, no demos required |
| Onboarding | Automated setup wizard, data import tools |
| Support | Knowledge base, AI chatbot, community forum |
| Billing | Stripe handles everything |
| Marketing | Content SEO, referral program (word of mouth) |

---

## Pricing Strategy

### Early Access (First 45 Campgrounds)

| Tier | Spots | Monthly | Per Booking | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Founder's Circle | 5 | $0 forever | $0.75 | Testimonials, case studies, product feedback |
| Pioneer | 15 | $0 for 12mo | $1.00 | Early traction, word of mouth |
| Trailblazer | 25 | $14.50 for 6mo | $1.25 | Volume, prove product-market fit |

### Standard Pricing (After Early Access)

- **$69/month + $2.50/booking**
- All features included (no tiered complexity)
- AI features included
- No marketplace commission (unlike Campspot's 10%)

### Setup Assistance Add-Ons (Optional)

DIY setup is always free. For campgrounds who want help:

| Service | Price | What's Included |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Quick Start | $249 | Site & rate config, payment setup, 30-min training call |
| Data Import (up to 500) | $299 | We import their exported reservation data |
| Data Import (501-2,000) | $599 | Same as above, larger volume |
| Data Import (2,001-5,000) | $999 | Same as above, larger volume |
| Data Import (5,000+) | Custom | Enterprise-scale migrations |

**Note:** Customer must export their own data from their old system (we can't access their accounts). We clean up and import it.

**Pay-over-time option:** Don't want to pay upfront? Add $1/booking until paid off.
- Quick Start ($249) = paid off after 249 bookings
- Data Import ($299-$999) = paid off after equivalent bookings

**Early access tiers include free data migration assistance.**

### Why This Works for Bootstrapping

- Recurring revenue (monthly) provides stability
- Per-booking fees scale with customer success
- No enterprise sales cycles requiring founder time
- Simple pricing = no negotiation needed
- Setup add-ons are pure margin (contracted out at ~$40/hr)

## Financial Projections

### Conservative Estimates

| Year | Campgrounds | Monthly Revenue | Monthly Costs | Monthly Profit | Annual Profit |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | 100 | $12,000 | $4,000 | $8,000 | $96,000 |
| 2 | 350 | $40,000 | $15,000 | $25,000 | $300,000 |

- 5% monthly churn (lose 5% of customers each month)
- Team costs scale with growth
- No VC funding, all growth from revenue

## Hiring Roadmap

### Hiring Philosophy

**Rule of thumb:** Each hire should cost <25-30% of monthly profit to stay healthy. Hire ahead of burnout, not after.

### Hiring Sequence

| # | Role | Monthly Cost | Revenue Needed | Campgrounds | Timeline |
|---|------|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Support/Onboarding | $2-3k | ~$10-12k/mo | ~100 | Month 6-9 |
| 2 | Part-time Dev | $4-5k | ~$25-30k/mo | ~250 | Month 12-18 |
| 3 | Marketing | $5-7k | ~$50k/mo | ~400 | Year 2 |
| 4 | Ops Manager/Leader | $8-12k | ~$100k/mo | ~800 | Year 3 |

---

### Hire #1: Support/Onboarding Person

**When:** ~100 campgrounds (~$10k/mo revenue)

**Why first:**
- Founder time is the bottleneck
- Every support ticket answered = time not growing the business
- Can run the paid setup assistance services ($249-$999) - pays for themselves
- Frees founder to focus on product and strategy

**Profile:** Virtual assistant or part-time contractor (20-30 hrs/week)
- Doesn't need to be technical
- Handles tier-1 support (password resets, how-do-I questions)
- Runs setup assistance services for customers
- Updates knowledge base
- Escalates only critical issues to founder

**Cost:** $2,000-3,000/month

---

### Hire #2: Part-time Developer

**When:** ~250 campgrounds (~$25-30k/mo revenue)

**Why second:**
- Bug fixes pile up faster than founder can handle
- Small feature requests from customers need attention
- Frees founder from being on-call for technical issues
- Can eventually grow to full-time as revenue increases

**Profile:** Senior freelancer (10-20 hrs/week)
- Can work independently without hand-holding
- Familiar with the stack (NestJS, Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL)
- Good communication skills for async work
- Ideally in a compatible timezone

**Cost:** $4,000-5,000/month

---

### Hire #3: Marketing Person

**When:** ~400 campgrounds (~$50k/mo revenue)

**Why third (not earlier):**
- Before this, word-of-mouth + SEO should drive growth
- Need product-market fit PROVEN before investing in marketing
- Earlier marketing spend is often wasted on a product still finding its footing
- By 400 campgrounds, you have case studies, testimonials, and proof

**Profile:** Content marketer (full-time or senior part-time)
- SEO expertise (blog posts, landing pages)
- Case study and testimonial creation
- Email marketing campaigns
- NOT a "growth hacker" or paid ads person (yet)

**Cost:** $5,000-7,000/month

---

### Hire #4: Ops Manager / Leader

**When:** ~800 campgrounds (~$100k/mo revenue)

**Why last:**
- This is the "founder steps back" hire
- Runs day-to-day operations so founder becomes advisory only
- Manages support team, coordinates dev priorities, handles escalations
- Expensive hire - needs stable, profitable business first

**Profile:** Operations generalist
- Has run a small SaaS or managed a team before
- Reliable operator, not a founder-type
- Good at systems, processes, and people management
- Can make decisions without constant founder input

**Cost:** $8,000-12,000/month

---

### Founder Role Evolution

| Phase | Campgrounds | Founder Focus | Hours/Week |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Pre-Hire #1 | 0-100 | Everything | 10-15 |
| Post-Hire #1 | 100-250 | Product + Strategy | 8-10 |
| Post-Hire #2 | 250-500 | Strategy + Key Relationships | 5-8 |
| Post-Hire #3 | 500-800 | Strategy + Vision | 4-6 |
| Post-Hire #4 | 800+ | Board-level decisions only | 2-4 |

---

### The Key Unlock

**Hire #1 is everything.** That's when you stop being a support rep and start being a CEO.

Before Hire #1: You're doing $15/hour work (support) instead of $500/hour work (strategy, product decisions, key relationships).

After Hire #1: You can focus on the things only you can do - product vision, key customer relationships, and growing the business.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Not Enough Time

**Mitigation:**
- Hire support help early (even at cost of profit)
- Build self-service everything
- Say no to custom requests that require founder time
- Accept slower growth in exchange for sustainability

### Risk: Competitor Pressure

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on underserved segment (small-medium parks)
- Compete on simplicity and service, not features
- Build switching costs through data and integrations
- Stay profitable (competitors burning cash will eventually struggle)

### Risk: Technical Issues

**Mitigation:**
- Keep architecture simple
- Use managed services (Railway, Vercel) to reduce ops burden
- Hire part-time developer by month 6-12
- Build monitoring and alerts to catch issues early

### Risk: Customer Support Overload

**Mitigation:**
- Invest heavily in documentation and knowledge base
- AI chatbot for common questions
- Community forum for peer support
- Hire support help before you're overwhelmed

- Time with your family

**The goal:** Build a business that works FOR you, not one that consumes you.
