# Phase 3: Analytics

## Goals

- Define core KPIs and reporting requirements.
- Implement analytics dashboards and exportable reports.
- Validate data integrity and freshness.

## Non-goals

- Fully automated anomaly detection (Phase 4).
- Advanced data science or ML personalization.
- External BI integrations beyond basic exports.

## Acceptance criteria (testable)

- KPI definitions are documented and verifiable.
- Analytics dashboards render expected data with automated tests.
- Export/report flows produce correct output in a fixture dataset.
- Lint, typecheck, unit tests, and smoke checks pass.

## Open questions

- Which KPIs are critical for launch?
- What reporting cadence and export formats are required?
- What data sources must be included?
