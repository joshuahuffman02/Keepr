# Changesets Guide

Changesets are used to version the shared packages in `platform/packages/*`.
Apps (`@keepr/web`, `@keepr/api`, `@keepr/ralph`) are ignored by config.

## When to add a changeset
- Any change to `platform/packages/shared`, `platform/packages/sdk`, or
  `platform/packages/integrations-sdk` that should ship to consumers.
- Use `--empty` for changes that do not require a release (docs-only or
  internal refactors with no published impact).

## Commands
- `pnpm changeset` (create a changeset entry)
- `pnpm changeset:status` (status check used in CI; base branch is `staging`)
- `pnpm changeset:version` (apply version bumps and generate changelog entries)

## Release flow (shared packages)
1. Create a changeset in the same PR as the package change.
2. Merge the PR to `staging`.
3. Run `pnpm changeset:version` when preparing a release batch.
4. Publish artifacts using the existing release process (no automated publish
   step is wired yet).

## Notes
- The config lives at `.changeset/config.json` and uses `staging` as the base
  branch.
- Package changelogs will be generated by Changesets when versioning runs.
