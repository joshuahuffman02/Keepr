## Use when

## Key frameworks

- Value Equation: (Dream Outcome x Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort).
- Growth levers: more customers, higher AOV, higher frequency.
- Offer creation: dream outcome, obstacles, solutions, delivery, stack value.

## Pricing and proof

- Price to value; increase certainty with guarantees and proof.
- Real scarcity only; no fake urgency.

## Lead generation

- Warm outreach, cold outreach, content, paid ads.
- Use short, direct scripts and follow-up cadence.

## Output

- Offer statement, pricing, and lead plan with scripts.

## Allowed scope

- Strategy and copy only; no legal or financial advice.

## Ask before proceeding if unclear

- Audience, proof assets, or constraints are unknown.

## Stop condition
