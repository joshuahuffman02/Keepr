- Use transforms/opacity for performance.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

## Deliverables

- Emotional goal and anxiety points.
- Micro-interactions (hover/focus/success/error).
- Motion timing/easing notes.
- Copy cues for success/correction.

## Allowed scope

- Design guidance only unless asked to implement.
