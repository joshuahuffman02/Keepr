## Introduction

Peak season practically runs itself—guests line up to book your sites. But what about those quiet months when occupancy drops to 20-30%? Every empty site represents lost revenue that you'll never recover.

The off-season doesn't have to mean empty sites and tight cash flow. With the right strategies, you can turn shoulder seasons and slow months into reliable revenue periods. Here are 10 proven approaches that successful campgrounds use to boost off-season bookings.

---

## 1. Adjust Pricing for the Season

The simplest lever: make off-season stays irresistible on price.

**Strategies:**

- 20-40% discount off peak rates
- Weekly/monthly specials with steeper discounts
- "Stay 3, pay for 2" or similar packages
- Last-minute booking deals

**Key insight:** Your off-season rate should be low enough that cost-conscious travelers specifically seek you out, but high enough to cover your costs.

## 2. Target the Snowbird Market

Retirees escaping winter are ideal off-season guests:

- Extended stays (weeks to months)
- Predictable annual patterns
- Community-oriented
- Lower maintenance requirements

**How to attract snowbirds:**

- Advertise in northern states and Canada
- Partner with RV clubs and groups
- Offer seasonal packages
- Create social programming for long-term guests

---

## 3. Host Off-Season Events

Give people a reason to come:

**Event ideas by season:**

- **Fall:** Halloween weekends, harvest festivals, fall color tours
- **Winter:** Holiday celebrations, chili cook-offs, craft weekends
- **Spring:** Easter events, fishing tournaments, wildflower weekends

**Event success factors:**

- Market heavily in advance
- Partner with local attractions
- Create package deals (camping + event)
- Make it worth the trip

## 4. Partner with Local Attractions

Off-season visitors often have specific interests:

**Potential partners:**

- Wineries and breweries
- Hiking/outdoor groups
- Hunting outfitters
- Local attractions and museums
- Sports venues
- Motorcycle and car clubs

**Partnership structures:**

- Cross-promotion (they promote you, you promote them)
- Package deals (stay + tickets/activities)
- Group discounts
- Referral programs

---

## 5. Attract Remote Workers

The rise of remote work creates opportunity:

**What remote workers need:**

- Reliable WiFi (critical!)
- Quiet daytime environment
- Comfortable working space
- Reasonable weekly/monthly rates

**Marketing message:**

> "Work from anywhere—why not work from a beautiful campground? Strong WiFi, peaceful surroundings, and weekly rates that make sense."

---

## 6. Welcome Sports and Activity Groups

Off-season activities bring targeted audiences:

| Activity        | Season      | Your Draw                            |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Hunting         | Fall/Winter | Proximity to land, early check-in    |
| Fishing         | Spring/Fall | Water access, fish cleaning stations |
| Hiking          | Fall/Spring | Trail access, group sites            |
| Mountain biking | Fall/Spring | Trail proximity                      |
| Photography     | Fall        | Scenic locations, wildlife           |

**Requirements:**

- Know what activities exist near you
- Accommodate group needs (storage, early/late hours)
- Partner with local outfitters

---

## 7. Offer Extended Stay Incentives

Empty sites earn nothing. Fill them with longer stays:

**Weekly rates:**

- Pay for 5, get 7 nights
- 15% weekly discount

**Monthly rates:**

- 40-50% off nightly rate
- Include utilities or cap them

**Seasonal packages:**

- Lock in 3-6 months at guaranteed rate
- Priority site selection for next year

## 8. Market to Local Staycationers

People in your region might not think of local camping:

**Marketing angles:**

- "Escape without the drive"
- "Weekend getaway 30 minutes from home"
- "Perfect for quick recharges"

**Local marketing tactics:**

- Facebook and Instagram targeting by location
- Partner with local businesses
- Community bulletin boards and newsletters
- Local event sponsorships

---

## 9. Improve Off-Season Amenities

Make staying comfortable during shoulder seasons:

**Investments that pay off:**

- WiFi upgrades (critical for remote workers, streaming)
- Heated facilities (restrooms, showers, gathering spaces)
- Fire pits and wood sales (cool evenings = campfire demand)
- Indoor gathering space for events
- Seasonal decorations (fall, winter holidays)

---

## 10. Build Your Email List Year-Round

Your best off-season marketing: direct to past guests.

**Year-round email strategy:**

- Collect emails from every guest
- Send seasonal newsletters
- Announce off-season specials first to email list
- Share events and activities
- Remind past guests about the experience they loved

**Sample off-season email:**

```
Subject: Fall colors are peaking—sites available this weekend!

better when the leaves are changing.

## Conclusion
