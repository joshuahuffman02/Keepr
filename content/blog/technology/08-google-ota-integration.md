## Introduction

Online travel agencies (OTAs) and Google can expand your reach dramatically. But managing multiple channels creates complexity. Here's how to integrate effectively.

---

## Key Channels

### Google
- Google Business Profile
- Google Hotels/Vacation Rentals
- Google Maps visibility
- Free to list, highest visibility

### Outdoor-Focused OTAs
- Hipcamp
- Recreation.gov
- The Dyrt
- Campendium

### General Travel OTAs
- Booking.com
- Airbnb (for cabins/glamping)

---

## Integration Benefits

### Expanded Reach
- Access new audiences
- Appear in more searches
- Reach travelers you wouldn't otherwise

### Synchronized Availability
- Real-time calendar sync
- No double-booking risk
- One source of truth

---

## Integration Challenges

### Commission Costs
- OTAs typically take 10-20%
- Factor into pricing strategy

### Calendar Sync
- Must update in real-time
- Delays cause double-bookings

### Rate Parity
- Some OTAs require matching rates
- Limits pricing flexibility

### Guest Communication
- Different systems, different processes
- May lose direct contact

---

## Integration Approaches

### Direct Integration
- Your software connects to OTA
- Automatic availability sync
- Best option when available

### iCal Sync
- Calendar feed between systems
- Simple but may have delays
- Better than manual

### Manual Management
- Update each channel separately
- Error-prone and time-consuming
- Avoid if possible

## Strategy Tips

1. Start with one or two channels
2. Prioritize direct bookings (lower cost)
3. Use OTAs for exposure, not dependency
4. Encourage OTA guests to book direct next time
5. Monitor commission costs vs. value

---

## Key Takeaways

- OTAs expand reach but have costs
- Real-time sync prevents errors
- Balance OTA exposure with direct booking encouragement
- Start simple and expand carefully
