## Common Objections

**"I'll lose the personal touch."**
You can still be personal—automated confirmations can include your personality, and you save time for meaningful guest interactions.

Good FAQs and clear descriptions answer most questions. Phones remain available for complex inquiries.

**"I'll lose control."**
You set the rules—pricing, minimums, policies. The system enforces them automatically.
