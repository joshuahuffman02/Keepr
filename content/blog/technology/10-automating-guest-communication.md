## Introduction

Every guest interaction requires communication: confirmations, reminders, thank-yous, review requests. Automation ensures these happen consistently while freeing you for more meaningful work.

## Messages to Automate

### Transactional (Essential)
- Booking confirmation
- Payment receipts
- Cancellation confirmations
- Modification confirmations

### Pre-Arrival (Recommended)
- 1 week before: Trip preparation tips
- 2-3 days before: Check-in details, directions
- Day of: Welcome, final reminders

### Post-Stay (Recommended)
- Same day: Thank you message
- 3-5 days after: Review request
- Seasonal: "We miss you" / rebooking prompt

## Automation Benefits

**Consistency:** Every guest receives the right information
**Timeliness:** Messages send at optimal moments
**Personalization:** Name, dates, site included automatically
**Time savings:** Once set up, runs without effort

## Setting Up Automation

### Step 1: Map Your Timeline
- When should each message send?
- What triggers each message?
- What information should each include?

### Step 2: Create Templates
- Write base content
- Add personalization fields (name, dates, site)
- Review for tone and clarity

### Step 3: Configure Triggers
- Booking created → confirmation
- X days before → reminder
- Check-out → thank you

### Step 4: Test Thoroughly
- Send test messages to yourself
- Verify all fields populate
- Check timing accuracy

## Sample Automation Flow

```
BOOKING MADE → Instant confirmation
        ↓
7 DAYS BEFORE → "Getting ready for your trip"
        ↓
2 DAYS BEFORE → "Almost time! Check-in details"
        ↓
CHECK-OUT DAY → "Thanks for staying!"
        ↓
3 DAYS AFTER → "Mind leaving a review?"

11 MONTHS AFTER → "Time to plan your next trip?"
```
