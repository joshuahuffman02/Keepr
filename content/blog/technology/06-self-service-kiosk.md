## Implementation Steps

1. **Choose your approach** (tablet, dedicated, mobile)
2. **Ensure software support** for kiosk mode
3. **Position strategically** (visible, covered, accessible)
4. **Test thoroughly** before go-live
5. **Provide backup** (staff contact for issues)

## Positioning Considerations

- Protected from weather
- Well-lit for evening use
- Visible from parking
- Near office for assistance backup

Not everyone should use the kiosk:

- Groups with complex needs
- Guests with balances to discuss
- Anyone who prefers personal service

Provide clear "For assistance, call..." signage.
