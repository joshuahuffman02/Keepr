## Common Concerns (Addressed)

**"I'm not tech-savvy."**
Modern systems are designed for simplicity. If you can use a smartphone, you can use campground software.

**"My guests prefer phone calls."**
Many still will call—and digital systems help handle those calls faster, not replace them.

**"It's expensive."**
The cost is typically offset by increased bookings, reduced errors, and time savings.
