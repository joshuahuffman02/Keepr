## Introduction

The RV industry is booming. RVIA reports record shipments, and the pandemic created millions of new RV owners who aren't going away. But with growth comes competition, and RV parks that don't modernize risk losing guests to parks that have.

Here are the five features your RV park software must have in 2025 to stay competitive and maximize revenue.

## 1. Mobile-First Online Booking

### Why It Matters

73% of travel bookings now happen on mobile devices. If your booking process isn't smooth on a phone, you're losing reservations.

### What "Mobile-First" Actually Means

**It's NOT just:**
- A desktop website that shrinks on mobile
- A phone number to call for reservations
- A PDF form to download and email back

**It IS:**
- A booking flow designed for thumb navigation
- Site photos and descriptions optimized for small screens
- Apple Pay and Google Pay for instant checkout
- Real-time availability that updates immediately
- Booking confirmation delivered instantly via text

### The Cost of Not Having It

Parks without mobile booking report:
- 30-40% of booking attempts abandoned mid-process
- Higher call volume (costly staff time)
- Lost last-minute bookings (someone in their RV searching for tonight)
- Lower review scores ("booking was difficult")

### What to Look For

- True mobile responsive design (not just mobile-compatible)
- Under 3 minutes to complete a booking
- No app download required
- SMS confirmation alongside email
- Digital check-in integration

## 2. Dynamic Pricing Engine

### Why It Matters

Static pricing leaves money on the table. When you charge the same rate for a holiday weekend as a random Tuesday in October, you're either missing revenue or missing bookings.

### How Dynamic Pricing Works

Modern pricing engines adjust rates based on:

**Demand signals:**
- Day of week (weekends vs. weekdays)
- Season (peak vs. shoulder vs. off-season)
- Local events (festivals, holidays, sports)
- Lead time (last-minute vs. far-advance bookings)
- Current occupancy (fill gaps, maximize sold-out weekends)

**Historical patterns:**
- What dates sold out last year
- Which rates converted best
- Weather impact on bookings
- Repeat guest behavior

### The Revenue Impact

Parks using dynamic pricing typically see:
- 15-25% revenue increase
- Higher occupancy in shoulder season
- Premium capture on high-demand weekends
- Fewer deeply discounted last-minute sites

### What to Look For

- Automated rate adjustments (not just suggestions)
- Configurable rules you control
- Override capability for special situations
- Visual calendar showing rate variations
- Competitor rate awareness (ideal but advanced)

## 3. Utility Metering and Billing

### Why It Matters

Electric costs are among the highest variable expenses for RV parks. As RVs get larger with more amenities and electric vehicles proliferate, power consumption is climbing.

Passing utility costs to guests who use them is fair and increasingly expected.

### Current State of the Industry

- Many parks still offer "unlimited" electric
- Some charge a flat daily fee regardless of usage
- Few accurately meter and bill for actual consumption

This means:
- Heavy users (50-amp, AC running 24/7) are subsidized by light users
- Your electricity costs are unpredictable
- Price-sensitive guests pay the same as power-hungry ones

### What Modern Metering Looks Like

**Site-level metering:**
- Smart meters on each site
- Real-time usage visible to guests
- Automatic billing integration

**Billing flexibility:**
- Per-kWh billing (actual usage)
- Tiered rates (first 30 kWh included, then $X/kWh)
- Flat daily add-on option
- EV charging surcharges

**Guest transparency:**
- Usage dashboard in guest portal
- Mid-stay alerts for high usage
- Final bill breakdown

### What to Look For

- Integration with smart meter hardware
- Automated billing in reservation system
- Guest-facing usage display
- Flexible rate structure configuration
- EV charging rate capability

## 4. AI-Powered Operations

### Why It Matters

Artificial intelligence isn't futuristic anymore. Parks using AI tools today are saving time, making better decisions, and serving guests better.

### Practical AI Applications for RV Parks

**Demand Forecasting:**
- Predict which weekends will sell out
- Anticipate staffing needs
- Plan maintenance around low-occupancy windows
- Know when to stop discounting

**Smart Communication:**
- Chatbots handling common questions 24/7
- AI-drafted responses to emails
- Personalized communication at scale
- Language translation for international guests

**Pricing Optimization:**
- Rate recommendations based on patterns
- Competitive positioning insights
- Revenue opportunity identification
- Price testing and learning

**Operational Efficiency:**
- Housekeeping task prioritization
- Maintenance prediction (when something's likely to fail)
- Staff scheduling optimization
- Inventory reorder suggestions

### What to Look For

- AI features included (not upsold separately)
- Practical, not gimmicky applications
- Human override always available
- Transparent about what AI is doing
- Learns from your park's specific patterns

## 5. Integrated Guest Portal with Self-Service

### Why It Matters

Guest expectations are shaped by Amazon, Airbnb, and airlines. They expect:
- Self-service for routine tasks
- Information at their fingertips
- Mobile-first experience
- Minimal waiting or calling

Parks that provide this experience get better reviews and reduce front desk workload.

### What Self-Service Looks Like

**Pre-Arrival:**
- Digital registration forms
- Document uploads (insurance, pet records)
- Site preference selection
- Add-on purchases (firewood, golf cart)
- Check-in time selection

**During Stay:**
- Digital keypad/lock codes
- Amenity reservations (dump station, bath house)
- Maintenance requests
- Store purchases
- Extension requests

**Post-Stay:**
- Digital checkout
- Final bill review
- Receipt access
- Review prompts
- Rebooking

### The ROI of Self-Service

**For guests:**
- No waiting in lines
- Handle tasks when convenient
- Information always accessible
- Seamless experience

**For you:**
- Reduced front desk workload
- Fewer phone calls
- Accurate guest information
- Higher guest satisfaction
- Upsell opportunities

### What to Look For

- Branded guest portal (your logo, colors)
- Mobile-optimized (not just desktop)
- No app download required
- Integration with reservation system
- Configurable workflows

## Bonus: Integration Capabilities

The days of standalone software are over. Your RV park tech stack needs to work together:

### Critical Integrations

**Payment processing:**
- Stripe, Square, or similar
- Stored payment methods
- Automated recurring billing

**Accounting:**
- QuickBooks Online
- Xero
- Automatic revenue recognition

**Channel management:**
- RoverPass, Campspot Marketplace
- Google Things to Do
- Your own website

**Hardware:**
- Smart locks
- Utility meters
- Gate systems
- POS terminals

### What to Look For

- Open API for custom integrations
- Pre-built integrations for common tools
- No extra charge for integration use
- Webhook support for real-time updates

## Evaluating Your Current System

Ask yourself:

1. **Mobile booking:** Can guests complete a reservation on their phone in under 3 minutes?

2. **Dynamic pricing:** Do your rates automatically adjust based on demand?

3. **Utility billing:** Can you bill guests for actual electric usage if desired?

4. **AI features:** Is AI helping you make decisions and save time?

5. **Guest portal:** Can guests self-service check-in, purchases, and requests?

If you answered "no" to more than two of these, your software is holding you back.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Mobile-first booking** is table stakes, not a nice-to-have
- **Dynamic pricing** is proven to increase revenue 15-25%
- **Utility metering** is fair and increasingly expected
- **AI features** should be included, not upsold
- **Self-service portals** reduce workload and improve satisfaction

---

## Conclusion

The RV park industry is becoming more competitive as more parks open and more guests have options. The parks that thrive will be those that invest in modern technology that serves guests better and operates more efficiently.

You don't need to become a tech company. You need software that includes these features out of the box, priced fairly, and designed for parks like yours.

The guest driving past three RV parks to get to yours? They'll book where the experience is best. Make sure that's you.
