## Introduction

Minimum stay requirements are a double-edged sword. Done right, they maximize revenue during high-demand periods and reduce turnover costs. Done wrong, they frustrate potential guests and leave money on the table.

The key is strategic minimums—rules that make business sense, can be clearly communicated, and feel fair to guests. This guide covers when to implement minimums, how to set them appropriately, and how to handle the inevitable exceptions.

## Why Minimum Stays Matter

### The Single-Night Problem

Single-night stays create several challenges:

**Revenue efficiency:**
- A Saturday-only guest blocks your entire weekend
- You can't sell Friday-Saturday or Saturday-Sunday packages
- Peak demand produces minimum revenue

**Operational costs:**
- Same check-in/out effort regardless of stay length
- Same cleaning and turnover time
- Staff time per guest night is highest for short stays

**Example impact:**
```
Scenario: Popular July Saturday

Option A: Accept 1-night Saturday booking at $60
Total revenue: $60
Friday: Empty
Sunday: Empty

Option B: Require 2-night weekend minimum at $55/night
Total revenue: $110
Friday: Filled
Sunday: May also book
```

### The Strategic Balance

Minimums work when demand justifies them. Key principle:

> If you can fill the site anyway with a multi-night stay, set a minimum.
> If you can't, don't—an empty site earns nothing.

## When to Use Minimum Stays

### Peak Weekends

Most campgrounds should have weekend minimums during peak season:

| Period | Recommended Minimum |
|--------|-------------------|
| Peak summer weekends | 2 nights |
| Holiday weekends | 3 nights |
| Shoulder season weekends | 2 nights or none |
| Weekdays | None |
| Off-season | None |

### Holiday Periods

Major holidays warrant extended minimums:

| Holiday | Typical Minimum |
|---------|----------------|
| Memorial Day weekend | 3 nights (Fri-Sun) |
| July 4th week | 3-4 nights |
| Labor Day weekend | 3 nights |
| Thanksgiving | 2-3 nights |
| New Year's | 2 nights |

### Special Events

When local events drive extra demand:

- Festivals, fairs
- Sporting events
- Rallies in your area
- Seasonal attractions (fall colors, etc.)

## Designing Your Minimum Stay Rules

### Rule Structure

Keep it simple enough for guests to understand:

**Good:**
```
Weekend Minimums (May 15 - September 15):
• Regular weekends: 2-night minimum (Fri-Sat or Sat-Sun)
• Holiday weekends: 3-night minimum
• Weekdays: No minimum
```

**Too complex:**
```
2-night minimum applies to Friday-Saturday unless occupancy 
is below 75% in which case 1-night is allowed except during
holidays when 3-nights applies unless...
```

### Site Type Variations

Different site types may warrant different minimums:

| Site Type | Standard Weekend | Holiday |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Basic tent sites | 2 nights | 2 nights |
| Standard RV sites | 2 nights | 3 nights |
| Premium/waterfront | 2 nights | 3 nights |
| Cabins | 2-3 nights | 3-4 nights |

### Booking Window Adjustments

Consider releasing minimums as dates approach:

- **30+ days out:** Strict minimums apply
- **14-29 days out:** Consider 1-night requests
- **7 days out:** Fill gaps—accept any length
- **Day-of:** Definitely accept any length

This maximizes advance multi-night bookings while filling last-minute gaps.

---

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Automate in Your Booking System

Manual enforcement creates errors and inconsistency. Configure your software to:

- Automatically reject bookings below minimum
- Display minimum requirements on availability calendar
- Allow staff override for exceptions

### 2. Communication is Critical

Guests should never be surprised by minimums:

**On booking page:**
```
📅 Weekend Note: June-August weekends require a 2-night 
minimum stay. Looking for a Saturday-only trip? Check 
September availability or give us a call—we sometimes 
have openings!
```

**In confirmation:**
```
Your reservation is for [X] nights, meeting our weekend 
minimum stay requirement.
```

### 3. Gap-Filling Strategies

Minimums create gaps. Plan for them:

**The "Gap Night" problem:**
- Guest A: Thursday-Saturday
- Guest B: Sunday-Tuesday
- Saturday night is orphaned

**Solutions:**
- Allow 1-night extensions to existing bookings
- Discount orphan nights
- Release minimum for gap-filling within 7 days
- Accept walk-ins for gap nights

---

## Handling Exception Requests

Guests will ask for exceptions. Have a consistent approach:

### When to Grant Exceptions

Consider saying yes when:
- Gap night that won't sell otherwise
- Close to arrival date with low occupancy
- Loyal returning guest
- Obvious special circumstance

### When to Hold the Line

Stick to policy when:
- High-demand period that will sell out
- Pattern of exception-seeking from same guest
- Long in advance of date
- Would set precedent you can't maintain

### The Right Language

**Granting exception:**
> "Normally we require 2 nights, but we do have a gap that Saturday, so I can make that work for you. Would you like me to book it?"

**Declining exception:**
> "I understand, but our July weekends require a 2-night minimum and we expect to fill completely. I can offer you [alternative dates] or put you on our waitlist if something opens up."

## The Revenue Math

### Calculating Optimal Minimums

Compare historical performance:

**Without minimums:**
- Saturday: 95% occupied (mix of 1 and 2+ night)
- Friday: 70% occupied
- Sunday: 60% occupied
- Average weekend occupancy: 75%

**With 2-night weekend minimum:**
- Saturday: 85% occupied (some turned away)
- Friday: 85% occupied (attached to Saturday)
- Sunday: 65% occupied (some attached)
- Average weekend occupancy: 78%
- But: Higher revenue per guest

**Key metric:** Revenue per available site-night, not just occupancy.

### When Minimums Hurt

Signs your minimums are too strict:
- Significant weekend vacancies
- High rate of bounce from booking page
- Many exception requests you're granting
- Competitor has availability you don't

Signs to increase minimums:
- Selling out instantly
- Waitlists for dates
- Could command higher prices
- Significant gap-night problem

---

## Special Situations

### Shoulder Season Transition

Gradually adjust minimums with demand:

```
Peak Season (June 15 - August 15): 2 nights
Early Shoulder (May 15 - June 14, Aug 16-31): 2 nights weekends
Late Shoulder (Sept, Oct): None or 2 nights on holiday weekends
Off-Season: No minimums
```

### Group Reservations

Groups often need custom terms:
- Multi-site groups might get extended minimums
- Rallies often book Thursday-Sunday (4 nights)
- Factor group needs into your rules

### Long-Term Guests

Weekly and monthly guests supersede nightly minimums—obviously.

### Cabins vs. Campsites

Cabins typically warrant longer minimums:
- Higher cleaning/turnover costs
- Different guest expectations
- Market precedent (vacation rentals often have minimums)

---

## Monitoring and Adjusting

### Track These Metrics

Quarterly or seasonally, review:

- Booking attempts that hit minimum (bounce rate)
- Gap nights and fill rate
- Revenue per site-night by period
- Waitlist length for peak dates
- Exception grant rate

### Annual Review

Each year before booking opens:

- Did last year's minimums work?
- Did demand increase or decrease?
- What did competitors do?
- Any new events that affect demand?

Adjust before the season starts, not mid-season.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Minimums protect peak revenue** — Don't let 1-night bookings block your best weekends
- **Demand justifies strictness** — Only apply minimums where you can fill with longer stays
- **Communicate clearly** — Never surprise guests with requirements
- **Build in flexibility** — Allow overrides for gap-filling and special circumstances
- **Review and adjust** — Minimums should evolve with your business

---

## Conclusion

Minimum stay requirements are a revenue optimization tool, not a guest punishment. When applied thoughtfully—matching demand patterns, communicated clearly, and balanced with flexibility—they maximize your peak period revenue without turning away guests unnecessarily.

The sweet spot: rules that ensure high-demand periods fill with multi-night stays while preserving flexibility to capture every dollar during slower times.
