## Introduction

A 50-RV club rally, a family reunion taking 15 sites, a motorcycle club weekend gathering—group reservations can be some of your most lucrative bookings. They fill multiple sites at once, often during shoulder seasons, and come with built-in coordination from the group organizer.

But groups also bring complexity: complex contracts, varied arrival times, last-minute changes, and higher stakes if things go wrong. Mismanaging a group event can damage your reputation in an entire community.

This guide covers how to successfully book, plan, and execute group events at your campground.

## Understanding Group Business

### Types of Group Reservations

| RV Club Rallies       | 20-100+ rigs | Organized, experienced, regular events  |
| Family Reunions       | 5-30 sites   | Mixed experience levels, one-time event |

### Why Groups Matter

**Marketing benefits:**

- Exposure to new potential guests

**Challenges:**

## The Group Booking Process

### Step 1: Inquiry Handling

When a group inquires, gather essential information:

**Initial questions:**

- Organization name and contact
- Approximate dates and flexibility
- Number of sites needed
- Type of sites required (size, hookups)
- Any special requirements (meeting space, catering)
- Is this a new or recurring event?

**Respond quickly.** Groups often contact multiple campgrounds simultaneously.

### Step 2: Site Planning

Before confirming, assess fit:

**Capacity check:**

- Do you have enough contiguous or nearby sites?
- Can you accommodate their RV sizes?
- Will this block too much transient capacity?

**Layout planning:**

- Can the group be clustered together?
- Where is the best location for their activities?
- Parking for day visitors?
- Access to facilities they'll need?

### Step 3: Proposal and Negotiation

Provide a formal proposal:

```markdown
GROUP RESERVATION PROPOSAL

Event: [Club Name] Annual Rally
Dates: [Date] - [Date]
Sites: [Number] [Site types]
Group Rate: $[X] per night per site

Includes:
• Reserved site cluster in Area [X]
• Use of pavilion for group dinners
• Welcome packet for each rig
• Dedicated contact during event

Requirements:
• Signed contract and 50% deposit by [Date]
• Final count and payment by [Date]
• Group coordinator on-site during event

Please confirm by [Date] to secure these dates.
```

### Step 4: Contract Signing

**Never proceed without a signed contract.** Group contracts should include:

**Essential elements:**

- Event name, dates, number of sites
- Pricing (per site, total, any extras)
- Deposit amount and due date
- Final payment terms
- Cancellation policy (often stricter than standard)
- Site assignment process
- Group coordinator responsibilities
- Campground liability/insurance
- Rules and expectations

### Step 5: Pre-Event Coordination

In the weeks before arrival:

**4-6 weeks out:**

- Confirm final count
- Assign specific sites
- Review schedule/activities
- Coordinate any special needs

**1-2 weeks out:**

- Send arrival instructions
- Confirm group coordinator contact
- Prepare welcome materials
- Brief staff on the event

**Day before:**

- Final site preparation
- Ensure all services functional
- Staff awareness of arrival schedule

## Pricing Group Reservations

### Discount Structure

Groups expect discounts. Common approaches:

| Group Size  | Typical Discount |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| 5-9 sites   | 10%              |
| 10-19 sites | 15%              |
| 20+ sites   | 20-25%           |
| 50+ sites   | Negotiated       |

**Important:** Discounts should reflect actual savings, not just give away revenue.

### What Justifies Group Discounts?

You're saving money on:

- Marketing/acquisition costs
- Multiple booking transactions
- Variable occupancy risk (guaranteed fill)
- Possibly slower seasons

You're investing in:

- Relationship building
- Future bookings
- Word-of-mouth marketing

### Add-On Revenue Opportunities

Recapture some discount through add-ons:

- Pavilion/meeting space rental
- Catering or food service
- Firewood bundles
- Golf cart rentals
- Activity equipment rental
- Welcome packets
- Group photos

## Rally and Event Logistics

### Site Clustering

Groups strongly prefer to be together. Plan for:

**Cluster assignments:**

- Block adjacent sites
- Consider noise (group activities) vs. regular guests
- Position gathering areas centrally
- Plan for varying RV sizes

**The "good neighbor" buffer:**

- If possible, leave one row between group and transient sites
- Or place group in section with fewer transients

### Common Areas and Activities

**Typical group needs:**

- Large gathering space (pavilion, fire ring area)
- Power for presentations or music
- Parking for visitors or day guests
- Space for portable canopies if allowed
- Clear area for group photos

**Activity coordination:**

- Will they need quiet hours exceptions?
- Any road closures for parades/processionals?
- Compatibility with other campground activities?

### Group Check-In

**Don't** try to check in 50 RVs through normal process.

**Efficient group check-in:**

1. Pre-assign all sites before arrival
2. Provide organizer with complete roster and assignments
3. Set up dedicated check-in location if large group
4. Consider "escort" system—lead rigs to their section
5. Handle administrative details with organizer, not individuals

**Information packet per rig:**

- Site assignment and directions
- Campground map with group area highlighted
- WiFi password
- Event schedule
- Campground contact info

## During the Event

### Staff Presence

Assign a staff point-of-contact for the group:

- Available (or reachable) during event hours
- Authority to handle reasonable requests
- Communication channel with organizer

### Common Issues and Responses

| Issue                           | Solution                                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Late arrivals need site changes | Have contingency sites identified       |
| Equipment/utility problems      | Prioritize quick resolution             |
| Noise complaints from others    | Mediate early, remind of quiet hours    |
| Weather disruption              | Communicate alternatives, stay flexible |
| Medical or safety emergency     | Have emergency plan, execute calmly     |

### Protecting Other Guests

Groups shouldn't negatively impact non-group guests:

- Monitor noise levels during quiet hours
- Ensure common facilities remain accessible
- Address any behavioral issues promptly
- Communicate proactively with affected neighbors

---

## After the Event

### Post-Event Review

Within a week of departure:

**With the organizer:**

- Thank them for their business
- Ask for feedback (what worked, what didn't)
- Discuss next year's dates if appropriate
- Request testimonial or review

**Internal review:**

- What went well?
- What problems arose?
- How can we improve for next time?
- Document lessons learned

### Building Long-Term Relationships

The best group business is repeat business:

- Offer first-right-of-refusal on dates
- Maintain relationship through off-season
- Send holiday/seasonal greetings
- Invite to other campground events
- Make rebooking easy

## Key Takeaways

- **Groups are valuable** — they fill sites, create revenue, and build relationships

- **Logistics matter** — clustering, check-in, and activities need planning
- **Pricing should balance** — discounts reflect savings but protect margins
- **Relationships drive repeat business** — nurture organizer connections

## Conclusion

Group reservations require more planning than individual bookings, but the payoff is substantial: significant revenue, filled sites during slower periods, and exposure to communities of potential future guests.

The keys to success are clear contracts, thoughtful logistics, and excellent communication with group organizers. Get these right, and you'll build relationships that bring groups back year after year.
