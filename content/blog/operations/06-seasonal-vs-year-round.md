## Introduction

One of the most significant decisions in campground ownership is whether to operate seasonally or year-round. Each model comes with distinct advantages, challenges, and operational requirements—and the right choice depends on your location, market, and personal goals.

Whether you're evaluating which model suits a new property, considering extending your season, or just curious about how the other half lives, this guide covers everything you need to know about managing both seasonal and year-round campgrounds.

## Understanding the Two Models

### Seasonal Campgrounds

Seasonal campgrounds operate during peak camping months and close during the off-season. Typical seasons are:

- **Standard:** May through October (5-6 months)
- **Extended:** April through November (7-8 months)
- **Limited:** Memorial Day through Labor Day (3-4 months)

**Common in:** Northern states, mountain regions, areas with harsh winters

### Year-Round Campgrounds

Year-round campgrounds stay open 365 days. They maintain operations through winter months and serve guests regardless of season.

**Common in:** Southern states, coastal areas, destinations near winter attractions, near urban centers

## Comparing the Models

| Factor | Seasonal | Year-Round |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Annual Revenue Potential | Lower ceiling, concentrated | Higher ceiling, spread out |
| Staffing Complexity | Simpler, seasonal hiring | More complex, year-round needs |
| Facility Wear | Time to repair/upgrade | Continuous maintenance |
| Personal Time Off | Built-in off-season break | Must schedule actively |
| Cash Flow | Feast or famine | More consistent |
| Utility Costs | Lower annual total | Higher, but winter can be challenging |
| Guest Demographics | Vacation campers | Mix of vacation, long-term, snowbirds |

## Managing a Seasonal Campground

### Opening Season: The Spring Rush

The weeks before opening are critical. Plan for:

**6 Weeks Before Opening:**
- [ ] Inspect all utility systems (water, electric, septic)
- [ ] Test and repair any damaged equipment
- [ ] Clear debris from sites and common areas
- [ ] Re-staff or bring back seasonal employees

**2 Weeks Before Opening:**
- [ ] Complete grounds beautification (mowing, planting)
- [ ] Stock store and supplies
- [ ] Test reservation system and payment processing
- [ ] Launch pre-season marketing push

**Opening Day:**
- [ ] Staff training and refresher
- [ ] Soft opening with reduced capacity (optional)
- [ ] Be prepared for the inevitable surprises

### Peak Season Operations

During your operating months, you're running at full intensity:

- **Maximize every weekend** — Your revenue window is limited
- **Keep maintenance proactive** — No off-season repairs available
- **Build relationships** — Guests you impress now book next year
- **Document issues** — Note everything that needs winter attention

### Closing Season: The Autumn Transition

Closing properly protects your investment:

**Winterization Checklist:**
- [ ] Drain and blow out all water lines
- [ ] Winterize pump houses and restrooms
- [ ] Store removable equipment and signage
- [ ] Final site inspections
- [ ] Secure buildings against weather and pests
- [ ] Plan for periodic winter property checks

### Off-Season Responsibilities

The off-season isn't truly "off":

- **Maintenance projects** — Major repairs and improvements
- **Marketing and planning** — Website updates, price reviews
- **Reservations** — Take bookings for next season
- **Relationship building** — Industry events, networking
- **Rest and recharge** — You've earned it

## Managing a Year-Round Campground

### Winter Operations

Running through winter requires additional considerations:

**Infrastructure Needs:**
- Heated/insulated water lines or heated buildings
- Snow removal equipment and plans
- Weatherized restroom facilities
- Reliable heating for staff areas

**Staffing Adjustments:**
- Reduced staff levels match lower occupancy
- Cross-training for skeleton crews
- Snow removal responsibilities
- Cold-weather emergency procedures

**Guest Expectations:**
- Some guests specifically seek winter camping
- Snowbirds fleeing cold weather (depends on your climate)
- Long-term guests who live on-site
- Hunters, skiers, or other seasonal recreationists

### Occupancy Strategies by Season

Year-round campgrounds typically see this occupancy pattern:

| Season | Expected Occupancy | Strategy |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Summer Peak | 80-100% | Maximize rate, minimum stays |
| Shoulder (Spring/Fall) | 40-60% | Events, promotions, weekday deals |
| Winter | 10-40% | Long-term rates, extended stays |
| Holidays | Variable | Target specific segments |

### Long-Term and Extended Stay Guests

Year-round campgrounds often rely on long-term guests:

**Benefits of long-term guests:**
- Predictable, stable revenue
- Lower turnover costs
- Site maintenance partnership
- Word-of-mouth referrals

**Considerations:**
- Lower nightly rate (30-50% discount for monthly)
- State/local regulations on residency
- Balance with transient capacity
- Different service expectations

## Seasonal Considerations for Both Models

### Spring

- **Seasonal:** Opening preparations, marketing push
- **Year-round:** Transition from winter mode, facility freshening

### Summer

- **Both:** Peak operations, maximum revenue potential, full staffing

### Fall

- **Seasonal:** Closing preparation, winterization
- **Year-round:** Transition marketing to snowbirds/hunters, evaluate winter staffing

### Winter

- **Seasonal:** Maintenance projects, next-year planning, rest
- **Year-round:** Skeleton crew operations, long-term guest focus, essential maintenance only

## Financial Comparison

### Seasonal Revenue Model

```
Example: 50 sites, 150-day season, $50 avg nightly rate

Best case (70% avg occupancy):
50 sites × 150 days × 70% × $50 = $262,500

Realistic case (55% avg occupancy):
50 sites × 150 days × 55% × $50 = $206,250

Expenses compressed into operating season
No winter utility or staffing costs
```

### Year-Round Revenue Model

```
Example: 50 sites, 365-day season, variable occupancy

Peak season (120 days, 70% occ, $55 rate): $231,000
Shoulder (120 days, 45% occ, $45 rate): $121,500
Winter (125 days, 25% occ, $35 rate): $54,688

Annual total: $407,188

Higher revenue but ongoing expenses year-round
```

## Transitioning Between Models

### Extending a Seasonal Season

Consider extending your season if:
- Shoulder season bookings are strong
- Weather in your area is getting milder
- You've invested in winterized facilities
- Staff is willing to work longer

**Start gradually:**
1. Add one weekend in each direction
2. Market specifically to fall/spring travelers
3. Offer incentive pricing initially
4. Evaluate demand before committing further

### Converting to Year-Round

Full conversion requires:
- Significant infrastructure investment
- Different business model (long-term focus)
- Revised staffing strategy
- Understanding of winter guest market

**Return on investment considerations:**
- Calculate additional revenue potential
- Compare against infrastructure costs
- Model break-even scenarios
- Consider lifestyle impact

## Which Model Is Right for You?

### Choose Seasonal If:

- Your location has harsh, extended winters
- Tourist demand drops to near zero in winter
- You value significant time off
- Infrastructure isn't winterized
- Staff availability is seasonal

### Choose Year-Round If:

- Your location has mild winters or winter attractions
- Long-term guest demand exists
- You want maximum revenue opportunity
- Facilities are or can be winterized
- You prefer consistent operations over intensity

### Consider Hybrid Approaches:

- **Reduced winter operations:** Limited sites open, essential services only
- **Long-term only in winter:** Accept monthly guests only during off-season
- **Event-based winter:** Open for specific winter activities/holidays

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Seasonal campgrounds** focus intensely on peak months with built-in off-season recovery
- **Year-round campgrounds** generate more total revenue but require constant operations
- **Winter preparation** is critical for both models—different challenges, same importance
- **Long-term guests** often anchor year-round revenue
- **Hybrid models** can capture benefits of both approaches

---

## Conclusion

There's no universally "better" model—the right choice depends on your location, facilities, market, and personal preferences. Seasonal operations offer concentrated intensity with built-in breaks, while year-round operations offer maximum revenue potential with continuous demands.

The most successful campground owners align their operational model with their local market realities and personal goals. Know your guests, know your climate, and know yourself.
