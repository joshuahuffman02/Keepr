## Introduction

When emergencies strike, minutes matter. A clear, practiced emergency plan is the difference between orderly response and dangerous chaos. Whether it's a medical emergency, severe weather, wildfire, or other crisis, your campground needs documented procedures that every staff member knows and can execute.

This guide covers the essential components of a campground emergency preparedness plan—helping you protect guests, staff, and your property when it matters most.

## Why Emergency Planning Matters

### The Stakes

Campgrounds face unique emergency challenges:

- Guests unfamiliar with property and area

- Weather exposure greater than hotels
- Remote locations may delay emergency services

### Legal and Insurance Considerations

Beyond safety:

- Many jurisdictions require documented emergency plans
- Insurance policies may mandate specific procedures
- Liability exposure increases without proper planning
- Documentation protects you after incidents

## Conclusion

Emergency preparedness isn't about fear—it's about confidence. When your staff knows exactly what to do, they can respond calmly and effectively. When guests know you're prepared, they feel safe.

Build your emergency plan now, train your team, and practice regularly. The goal is that if an emergency ever occurs, your response is nearly automatic. Your guests, your staff, and your business will all be better for it.
