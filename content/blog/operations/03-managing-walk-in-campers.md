## Introduction

Every campground owner knows the scenario: it's 7 PM on a Friday, and a tired family pulls up hoping you have a site available. How you handle walk-in campers can mean the difference between a new loyal customer and a missed opportunity.

Walk-ins represent a unique segment of your business. Unlike guests who book weeks or months in advance, walk-in campers are often spontaneous travelers, road-trippers making flexible plans, or locals seeking a last-minute weekend escape. They're also an excellent opportunity to fill sites that might otherwise sit empty.

In this guide, we'll cover strategies for efficiently managing walk-in guests while maximizing their value to your campground.

## The Walk-In Opportunity

### Why Walk-Ins Matter

Walk-in campers often get overlooked in revenue planning, but they provide significant benefits:

- **Fill last-minute vacancies** from cancellations or no-shows
- **Reduce empty site nights** especially mid-week
- **No acquisition cost** unlike guests from paid advertising
- **Conversion opportunity** turn them into future advance bookers
- **Immediate revenue** no waiting for deposits to process

### Common Walk-In Types

Understanding who walks in helps you serve them better:

| Type | Characteristics | What They Need |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Road Trippers | Traveling through, flexible timing | Quick check-in, basic info |
| Weekend Escapees | Last-minute decision, often local | Speed and convenience |
| Overflow Guests | Turned away from full campgrounds | Availability confirmation |
| RV Nomads | Long-term travelers, experienced | Minimal fuss, fair pricing |
| First-Timers | New to camping, may have questions | Patient guidance, good site |

## Setting Up for Walk-In Success

### 1. Create a Clear Walk-In Policy

Your walk-in policy should address:

- **Acceptance hours** (e.g., "Walk-ins accepted until 10 PM")
- **Payment requirements** (full payment at check-in)
- **Site assignment process** (assigned vs. first-come)
- **Pricing** (same as online? Premium for convenience?)
- **Availability expectations** (no guarantees during peak)

Display this policy on your website and at your entrance.

### 2. Design an Efficient Check-In Process

Walk-in guests want to get to their site quickly—especially after a long drive. Streamline the process:

**Essential information to collect:**
- Name and contact info
- Vehicle details (license plate, RV length)
- Party size
- Length of stay
- Payment

**Nice-to-have but can skip:**
- Full home address (get email instead)
- Detailed emergency contact (for short stays)
- Marketing surveys (save for checkout)

Aim for **5 minutes or less** from arrival to site assignment.

### 3. Enable Self-Service Options

For campgrounds with limited staff or after-hours arrivals:

**Self-check-in kiosk:**
- Guest selects from available sites
- Enters information and pays
- Receives site map and access codes

**After-hours envelopes:**
- Pre-printed registration forms
- Site map with available sites marked
- Drop box for paperwork and payment
- Clear instructions posted

### 4. Real-Time Availability Visibility

Your front desk (or self-service system) needs instant access to:

- Which sites are available right now
- Site characteristics (hookups, size, location)
- Tonight's pricing
- Any maintenance blocks

Paper calendars and spreadsheets create friction. Digital systems let you answer "Do you have anything available?" in seconds.

## Walk-In Pricing Strategies

### Option 1: Same as Online (Recommended for Most)

Charge the same rate whether someone books online or walks in.

**Pros:**
- Simple and transparent
- No guest confusion or frustration
- Easy for staff to communicate

**Cons:**
- May undervalue the convenience you're providing

### Option 2: Walk-In Premium

Add $5-10 for same-day/walk-in convenience.

**Pros:**
- Rewards advance bookers
- Captures value of last-minute availability
- Encourages future advance bookings

**Cons:**
- May frustrate walk-in guests
- Requires clear communication

### Option 3: Dynamic Same-Day Pricing

Adjust walk-in rates based on occupancy:

- Low occupancy: Discount to fill sites
- High occupancy: Premium for remaining sites

**Pros:**
- Maximizes revenue based on demand
- Fills sites that would otherwise be empty

**Cons:**
- More complex to manage
- Requires good reservation software

## Training Your Staff for Walk-Ins

### The Right Greeting

First impressions matter, especially for tired travelers:

**Good:**
> "Welcome! Are you looking for a site tonight? Let me check what we have available."

**Not as good:**
> "Do you have a reservation?"

The first approach assumes good faith and helpfulness. The second implies they might not belong.

### Upselling Naturally

Walk-ins are often open to suggestions:

> "We have a few sites available. Site 24 is a standard back-in for $45, or Site 18 is waterfront with a great view for $60. Which sounds better for your trip?"

Present options rather than just assigning the cheapest available.

### Handling "Sold Out" Situations

When you're full, be helpful anyway:

1. Confirm you're truly full (check cancellations/no-shows)
2. Suggest nearby campgrounds that might have availability
3. Offer to take their info if a cancellation occurs
4. Provide a card for next time

A helpful response when you can't accommodate them builds goodwill for future visits.

## Converting Walk-Ins to Repeat Guests

Walk-in guests are hard-won—make sure they come back:

### During Their Stay

- Check in on them: "How's your site working out?"
- Provide a campground map and activity suggestions
- Mention any upcoming events or promotions

### At Checkout

- Ask about their experience
- Collect email for your newsletter
- Mention your loyalty program if you have one
- Offer to book their next visit at a preferred rate

### Follow-Up

Send a thank-you email within 48 hours:

> "Thanks for stopping by [Campground Name]! We loved hosting you. Book direct on our website for the best rates on your next adventure."

Include a booking link and perhaps a small discount code for advance reservations.

## Handling Common Walk-In Challenges

### Challenge: Peak Season Walk-Ins When You're Full

**Solution:** Keep 1-2 "hold-back" sites during peak season specifically for late arrivals. If unused by 8 PM, release them.

### Challenge: Walk-Ins During Unstaffed Hours

**Solution:** Implement a self-check-in kiosk or clear after-hours registration process with site map and drop box.

### Challenge: Walk-Ins from Problematic Guests

**Solution:** Trust your instincts. You have the right to refuse service. Have a polite but firm script ready.

### Challenge: Walk-Ins During a Full Office

**Solution:** Train check-in staff to handle walk-ins efficiently in parallel with phone and checkout traffic. Digital systems help here.
