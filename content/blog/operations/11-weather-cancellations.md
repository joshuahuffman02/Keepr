## Introduction

Weather is an inherent part of the camping experience—but when forecasts turn threatening, campground owners face a difficult balancing act. Should you refund guests who want to cancel due to a rainy forecast? What about extreme heat? At what point does weather become your responsibility versus theirs?

A clear, fair weather policy protects both your revenue and your guest relationships. Without one, you'll make inconsistent decisions under pressure and disappoint guests who feel treated unfairly.

This guide covers how to create and communicate weather policies that work for both you and your campers.

## Understanding Weather Expectations

### Camping ≠ Climate-Controlled

First principle: camping happens outdoors. Guests should expect:

- Rain is possible (and sometimes guaranteed)
- Temperatures vary from forecasts
- Wind, humidity, and other conditions are part of the experience
- "Perfect weather" is never guaranteed

**A reasonable baseline:** Ordinary weather conditions—including rain, heat, or cold within seasonal norms—are not grounds for refunds.

### When Weather Becomes Exceptional

Situations that may warrant policy exceptions:

| Condition | Severity Level |
|-----------|---------------|
| Rain | Normal — no exception |
| Heavy rain/storms | Normal unless severe warning |
| Heat advisory | Case-by-case |
| Severe thunderstorm warning | May warrant flexibility |
| Hurricane/tornado warning | Full accommodation |
| Mandatory evacuation | Automatic full refund/credit |
| flooding affecting sites | Full accommodation |

## Designing Your Weather Policy

### Principle 1: Clear Categories

Define distinct situations with specific responses:

**Category 1: Normal Weather (No Exceptions)**
- Rain, drizzle, overcast
- Temperatures within seasonal range (even uncomfortable)
- Wind under 30 mph
- Standard weather variance from forecast

**Standard policy applies:** Guests cancel according to normal cancellation terms.

**Category 2: Severe Weather Watches (Limited Flexibility)**
- Severe thunderstorm watch
- Flash flood watch
- Heat advisory

**Policy:** Offer date change or credit if guest has safety concerns. No automatic refunds.

**Category 3: Severe Weather Warnings (Full Flexibility)**
- Tornado/hurricane warning
- Severe thunderstorm warning in immediate area
- Dangerous flooding
- Extreme heat (heat emergency)

**Policy:** Full flexibility—refund, credit, or date change at guest preference.

**Category 4: Campground Closure or Evacuation**
- Mandatory evacuation order
- Campground closure due to conditions
- Sites uninhabitable or inaccessible

**Policy:** Automatic full refund or credit, no questions.

### Principle 2: Guest Decision vs. Your Decision

Distinguish between:

**Guest chooses not to come** (weather looks bad):
> Standard cancellation policy applies plus any weather-related flexibility you offer

**You close or evacuate**:
> Automatic full accommodation

This prevents gaming while ensuring fairness when conditions are genuinely dangerous.

### Principle 3: Timing Matters

Weather policies should consider when the decision is made:

- **Pre-arrival cancellation:** Apply your weather policy based on conditions
- **Mid-stay departure:** Prorate refund based on unused nights (if conditions warrant)
- **Day-of decision:** More flexibility for genuine safety concerns

## Sample Weather Policy

```markdown
WEATHER POLICY

ORDINARY WEATHER
Rain, heat, cold, and other normal conditions are part of
camping. We do not offer refunds for ordinary bad weather.
Standard cancellation policy applies.

SEVERE WEATHER WATCHES
If a severe weather watch (thunderstorm, flood, heat advisory)
is issued for our area, we will offer date changes or credits
for guests who wish to reschedule. Refunds are not automatically
provided but may be considered case-by-case.

SEVERE WEATHER WARNINGS
If a severe weather warning (tornado, hurricane, dangerous
conditions) is issued, you may cancel for a full refund or
credit. Your safety is our priority.

CAMPGROUND CLOSURE / EVACUATION
If we close the campground or a mandatory evacuation is issued,
you will receive a full refund or credit for all affected nights—
no questions asked.

## Communicating Weather Situations

### Proactive Communication

When severe weather approaches:

**24-48 hours before:**
```
Subject: Weather Update for Your Reservation

Hi [Name],

We're monitoring [weather situation] expected to affect 
our area on [dates].

Current status: [situation summary]

Your options:
• Proceed with your reservation as planned
• Reschedule to different dates (subject to availability)
• [Cancel per our weather policy]

We'll update you if conditions change. Please let us know
your preference by [time/date].

Stay safe,
[Campground]
```

**During active weather:**
- Text or call guests on-site with safety instructions
- Post updates at office/common areas
- Have emergency procedures ready

### Training Staff

Front-desk staff should:

- Know the weather policy completely
- Have authority for immediate date changes
- Know when to escalate to management
- Never argue about safety concerns

**Good response to weather cancellation request:**
> "I understand the weather looks concerning. Let me see what I can do. [Apply policy]. Would a credit for a future visit work for you, or would you like to try rescheduling?"

---

## Special Weather Situations

### Heat Waves

Extreme heat is increasingly common. Consider:

- At what temperature do you offer flexibility? (e.g., 105°F+)
- Heat advisory vs. normal hot summer days
- Guests with health concerns (elderly, children)

**Balanced approach:**
> "During heat advisories, we offer date changes or credits to guests with health concerns. Our pool/lake/AC facilities remain available for those who choose to stay."

### Winter Weather

For year-round campgrounds:

- Snow forecasts over [X] inches
- Ice storms
- Dangerously cold temperatures

### Hurricane Season

If you're in hurricane zones:

- Longer advance warning = standard policy applies earlier
- Consider hurricane-specific terms
- Insurance implications

---

## Financial Impact Management

### The Revenue Concern

Being too flexible costs money. But the alternative—forcing guests to stay or lose deposits during dangerous weather—costs more in:

- Reputation damage
- Liability concerns
- Chargeback risk
- Permanent guest loss

### Mitigation Strategies

**Waitlist management:**
- Keep waitlists for popular dates
- Fill cancelled slots when possible

**Insurance:**
- Some policies cover weather-related revenue loss
- Review your coverage

**Shoulder season opportunity:**
- Weather cancellations create openings
- Offer discounted rates to fill gaps

**Credit vs. refund:**
- Credits keep money in your ecosystem
- Guests more likely to return
- Offer credit as default, refund upon request

---

## When Guests Get Creative

### The "Weather Excuse"

Some guests use weather as cover for changed plans:

**Signs of possible misuse:**
- Request comes before any watch/warning
- Weather is normal for the season
- Multiple "weather" cancellations from same guest
- Request 3 days before for weather 5 days out

**Response approach:**
- Apply policy consistently
- Don't accuse, but don't accommodate beyond policy
- Note patterns in guest record

### The Morning-Of Check

Guest claims dangerous weather when conditions are fine:

> "I see the forecast shows [actual conditions]. Our policy covers [specific situation]. I can offer [what policy allows], but we can't provide a full refund for current conditions."

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Define categories:** Normal weather vs. watches vs. warnings vs. closure
- **Guest choice ≠ your closure:** Different treatment for each
- **Communicate proactively:** Don't wait for guests to ask
- **Credits over refunds:** Keep guests in your system
- **Document everything:** Conditions, decisions, communications

---

## Conclusion

Weather is part of camping—but dangerous conditions deserve thoughtful policies. The goal is protecting guests when conditions are genuinely unsafe while not giving away the farm for ordinary rain.

A clear, written policy applied consistently creates trust. Guests who know you'll treat them fairly in bad situations book with more confidence—and forgive you when you hold the line on questionable requests.
