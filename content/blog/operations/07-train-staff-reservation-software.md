## Introduction

You've invested in modern reservation software to streamline your campground operations—but the benefits only materialize if your team actually knows how to use it. Poor software training leads to frustrated staff, booking errors, unhappy guests, and ultimately, reverting to the old manual methods.

The good news is that training staff on campground software doesn't have to be complicated or time-consuming. With the right approach, you can have team members confidently handling reservations within days, not weeks.

This guide covers everything you need to successfully onboard your staff on reservation software, from pre-training preparation to ongoing skill development.

## Before Training Begins

### Know Your Software

Before training anyone else, ensure you (or a designated power user) have mastered:

- Every feature you plan to use
- Common error messages and how to resolve them
- Workarounds for your specific workflow needs
- How to get support from the software vendor

You can't teach what you don't know.

### Identify Staff Roles and Needs

Not everyone needs the same level of training:

| Role                | Training Focus                                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Front Desk/Check-in | Reservations, check-in/out, payments, daily tasks     |
| Maintenance         | Site status updates, maintenance blocks, basic search |
| Management          | Reporting, settings, pricing, full system overview    |
| Seasonal Staff      | Essential tasks only, with clear escalation paths     |

Match training depth to job requirements.

### Prepare Training Materials

Create or gather:

- [ ] Quick reference cards (laminated for durability)
- [ ] Step-by-step guides for common tasks
- [ ] Training login/sandbox account if available
- [ ] Screen recordings of key processes
- [ ] FAQ document for common questions

## Core Training Curriculum

### Module 1: System Overview (30 minutes)

Start with the big picture before diving into tasks:

**Cover:**

- What the software does and why you chose it
- Main sections/modules of the interface
- How to log in and log out securely
- Basic navigation patterns
- Where to find help

**Hands-on:** Have trainees log in and explore the interface without pressure.

### Module 2: Looking Up Information (45 minutes)

Before making changes, staff should be comfortable finding information:

**Key tasks:**

- Search for existing reservations
- View site availability/calendar
- Look up guest history
- Find today's arrivals and departures
- Check site status (available, occupied, maintenance)

**Hands-on:** Give trainees 5-10 lookup challenges using real or sample data.

### Module 3: Making Reservations (1 hour)

This is the core skill for front-desk staff:

**Process walkthrough:**

1. Check availability for requested dates
2. Create new reservation
3. Enter guest information
4. Select site (or allow auto-assignment)
5. Add any extras/add-ons
6. Take deposit/payment
7. Send confirmation

**Common scenarios to practice:**

- Standard weekend reservation
- Specific site request
- Multi-night stay
- Returning guest (using existing profile)

**Error handling:**

- What happens if site is unavailable?
- What if payment fails?
- How to correct entered mistakes

### Module 4: Check-In and Check-Out (45 minutes)

Daily operations training:

**Check-in process:**

1. Pull up reservation
2. Verify guest information
3. Collect any balance due
4. Assign/confirm site number
5. Mark as checked-in
6. Provide site map and information

**Check-out process:**

1. Locate checked-in guest
2. Review any additional charges
3. Process final payment if needed
4. Mark as checked-out
5. Update site status

**Walk-in handling:**

- How to create same-day reservations
- Quickly checking availability
- Processing immediate payments

### Module 5: Modifications and Cancellations (45 minutes)

Handling changes is inevitable:

**Modifications:**

- Changing dates (extending, shortening)
- Changing site assignments
- Adding or removing guests
- Adding extras or services

**Cancellations:**

- Full cancellation process
- Applying cancellation policy (fees, credits)
- Refund processing
- Documenting reason

**Important:** Train staff on your cancellation policy so they can explain it to guests.

### Module 6: Payments and Adjustments (45 minutes)

Money matters require extra care:

**Payment tasks:**

- Taking deposits
- Processing balances
- Handling multiple payment methods
- Issuing refunds
- Applying credits or discounts
- Voiding transactions (if permitted)

**Important policies:**

- Who has authority to give discounts?
- Who can process refunds?
- What documentation is required?

## Training Methods That Work

### 1. Show, Then Do, Then Teach

The most effective sequence:

1. **Show:** Trainer demonstrates the task
2. **Do:** Trainee performs the task with guidance
3. **Teach:** Trainee explains the task to someone else

By step 3, the skill is solidified.

### 2. Use Real Scenarios

Abstract training doesn't stick. Use actual situations:

- "Create a reservation for the Smith family, 2 adults 2 kids, July 14-16, they want a waterfront site"
- "Mrs. Johnson called to change her arrival date from Friday to Saturday, same site"
- "Process a walk-in for tonight, one RV, full hookup"

### 3. Encourage Questions

Create an environment where asking is encouraged:

> "There are no stupid questions during training. It's better to ask now than guess later."

Keep a running list of questions for future FAQ updates.

### 4. Training Sandbox

If your software offers a demo/training environment, use it:

- Staff can practice without fear of real consequences
- More willing to explore and make mistakes
- Can reset scenarios for repeated practice

If no sandbox exists, consider creating test reservations during slow periods.

### 5. Shadowing and Buddy System

After formal training:

- New staff shadows experienced staff for 2-3 shifts
- Then experienced staff shadows new staff (guiding but not doing)
- Gradual independence with backup available

## Quick Reference Materials

### Create One-Page Guides

For each common task, create a simple reference:

```markdown
CREATING A NEW RESERVATION

1. Click [New Reservation] button
2. Enter arrival and departure dates
3. Select site type → Click [Check Availability]
4. Choose site from available options
5. Enter guest: Name, email, phone
6. Add any extras/add-ons
7. Select payment method → Process payment
8. Click [Complete Reservation]
9. Ask: "Would you like a confirmation email?"

NOTES:
• Always confirm site availability before quoting price
• RVs over 35' must use premium sites (A1-A10)
```

### Laminated Desk Cards

Provide quick-reference cards for the most common tasks staff do daily:

- Lookup reservation
- Check-in guest
- Check-out guest
- Process payment
- Look up availability

### Troubleshooting Guide

Document common issues and solutions:

| Problem                 | Cause           | Solution                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Can't find reservation  | Wrong date/name | Try alternate search, check spelling |
| Payment won't process   | Card declined   | Try again, request alternate payment |
| Site shows wrong status | Sync delay      | Refresh page, check manually         |
| System is slow          | Internet issue  | Check connection, wait and retry     |

## Ongoing Training

### Regular Refreshers

Schedule periodic training updates:

- When software updates with new features
- Before peak season begins
- When new staff joins
- Whenever patterns of errors emerge

### Track Common Errors

Monitor for recurring issues:

- Incorrect pricing quoted
- Double-bookings
- Failed payment handling
- Policy miscommunication

Use errors as training opportunities, not punishment.

### Celebrate Competency

Acknowledge staff who master the system:

- "Ask [Name]" designation for peer questions
- Recognition for error-free periods
- Input on workflow improvements

## Key Takeaways

- **Match training depth to role** — Not everyone needs to know everything
- **Show, do, teach** — The proven sequence for skill retention
- **Use real scenarios** — Abstract training doesn't translate to real work
- **Provide reference materials** — Quick guides and cheat sheets reduce errors
- **Ongoing training matters** — Skills fade without reinforcement

## Conclusion

Well-trained staff transform reservation software from an expense into an advantage. When your team can confidently handle reservations, check-ins, payments, and modifications, you'll see fewer errors, happier guests, and smoother operations.

Invest the time upfront to train properly, create solid reference materials, and maintain skills through ongoing practice. The payoff is a team that actually enjoys using the technology rather than fighting against it.
