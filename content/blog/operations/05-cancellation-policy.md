## Introduction

Your cancellation policy is one of the most important documents in your campground's operations. Get it right, and you protect your revenue while maintaining guest goodwill. Get it wrong, and you either lose money to excessive cancellations or damage your reputation with policies guests perceive as unfair.

The challenge? Finding the sweet spot between protecting your business on peak weekends and remaining flexible enough that guests feel confident booking with you.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll walk through how to design a cancellation policy that works for both you and your guests, complete with templates you can adapt for your campground.

## Why Your Cancellation Policy Matters

### The Revenue Protection Side

Without a solid cancellation policy:
- Guests book "just in case" with no commitment
- Last-minute cancellations leave sites empty
- Peak weekends get held hostage by uncommitted reservations
- Revenue becomes unpredictable

### The Guest Experience Side

With an overly strict policy:
- Guests hesitate to book far in advance
- Bad reviews mention "unfair" policies
- Word-of-mouth suffers
- Guests book competitors instead

**The goal:** A policy that discourages frivolous bookings while remaining reasonable for legitimate circumstances.

## Core Elements of a Cancellation Policy

### 1. Cancellation Timeframes

Most campground policies use tiered timeframes:

| Timeframe | Typical Policy |
|-----------|---------------|
| 30+ days before | Full refund (minus small processing fee) |
| 14-29 days before | 50% refund or credit |
| 7-13 days before | Credit only (no refund) |
| Less than 7 days | No refund |
| No-show | No refund, full charge |

**Adjust these based on:**
- Your ability to resell the site
- Industry norms in your area
- Type of accommodation (RV site vs. cabin)

### 2. Deposit Requirements

Deposits serve two purposes: commitment and coverage.

**Common deposit structures:**
- **First night at booking** — Simple, clear
- **50% at booking** — Balanced commitment
- **Full prepayment** — Maximum protection, may deter bookings
- **No deposit** — Risky, high no-show rates

**Recommendation:** Require at least one night's deposit at booking for standard reservations. Consider higher deposits for:
- Peak season weekends
- Holiday periods
- Cabins or glamping units
- Extended stays
- Group reservations

### 3. Modification vs. Cancellation

Distinguish between changing a reservation and canceling it:

**Modifications (more flexible):**
- Date changes (when availability exists)
- Site upgrades or changes
- Adding/removing nights

**Consider allowing free modifications up to 7-14 days before arrival.** This keeps the guest engaged rather than canceling entirely.

### 4. Special Circumstances

Build in flexibility for situations beyond guests' control:

**Weather policies:**
- Mandatory evacuation = full refund or reschedule
- Campground closure = full refund
- Guest decides weather is bad = standard policy applies

**Emergency exceptions:**
- Medical emergencies (with documentation)
- Death in immediate family
- Military deployment

**Important:** Don't promise case-by-case evaluation in writing. Keep exceptions discretionary.

## Building Your Policy: Templates

### Standard Campground Policy Template

```markdown
CANCELLATION POLICY

DEPOSIT: One night's stay required at booking.

CANCELLATIONS:
• 14+ days before arrival: Full refund minus $10 processing fee
• 7-13 days before arrival: 50% refund
• Less than 7 days before arrival: No refund
• No-show: Full charge, no refund

MODIFICATIONS:
• Date and site changes: Free if requested 7+ days in advance,
  subject to availability
• Shortened stays: Follow cancellation policy for nights removed

EARLY DEPARTURES:
No refund for unused nights. Exceptions may be made at
management's discretion for emergencies.

WEATHER:
This is a campground. Weather happens! We do not refund due
to rain, heat, or cold. In the event of a mandatory evacuation
or campground closure, you will receive a full credit for
future use.

GROUP RESERVATIONS (5+ sites):
Separate terms apply. Non-refundable 50% deposit required.
Contact us for group booking agreement.
```

### Premium/Cabin Policy Template (Stricter)

```markdown
CABIN CANCELLATION POLICY

DEPOSIT: 50% of total stay due at booking.
BALANCE: Due 7 days before arrival.

CANCELLATIONS:
• 30+ days before arrival: Full refund minus $50 fee
• 14-29 days before arrival: 50% refund
• 7-13 days before arrival: Reservation credit only
• Less than 7 days: No refund

Cabins are limited and in high demand. Please book thoughtfully.

exists. No same-day or next-day modifications.
```

### Flexible/Guest-Friendly Policy Template

```markdown

We understand plans change! Our policy aims to be fair to you
while protecting our small business.

CANCELLATIONS:
• 48+ hours before arrival: Full refund
• Less than 48 hours: No refund, but we'll give you a credit
  good for one year

anything else. We'll do our best to accommodate.

## Peak Season Considerations

Your cancellation policy should be stricter for high-demand periods:

### Option 1: Separate Peak Season Policy

```markdown
PEAK SEASON NOTICE (May 15 - September 15):
All reservations during peak season require:
• Non-refundable deposit of first night
• 14-day cancellation notice for any refund
• No modifications within 7 days of arrival
```

### Option 2: Holiday-Specific Terms

```markdown
HOLIDAY WEEKEND POLICY
(Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, etc.)

All holiday weekend reservations are non-refundable.
Cancellations receive credit valid for one year for
non-holiday dates only.
```

### Option 3: Extended Stay Minimum

```markdown
PEAK WEEKEND POLICY:
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights during peak season
require a 2-night minimum stay. Single-night cancellations
are not permitted.
```

## Communicating Your Policy

### Where to Display

Your cancellation policy should appear:

- [ ] Checkout page (before payment)
- [ ] Confirmation email
- [ ] Reminder emails
- [ ] Website FAQ page
- [ ] Signage at check-in (optional)

### How to Present

**Do:**
- Use clear, plain language
- Break into bullet points
- Highlight key dates/deadlines
- Provide contact information for questions

**Don't:**
- Bury in legal jargon
- Hide in terms and conditions click-through
- Leave any gray areas
- Make it feel adversarial

### Sample Website Copy

```markdown
## Our Booking Policy

We keep things simple:

[OK] **Book with confidence** — Cancel 14+ days out for a full refund
[OK] **Life happens** — Cancel 7-13 days out and get 50% back
[WARN] **Last minute?** — Less than 7 days, we can't refund, but we'll
   try to rebook your site for you

Questions? Call us at [phone] or email [email]—we're happy to help!
```

## Enforcing Your Policy

### Be Consistent

The most important rule: apply your policy the same way to everyone.
- Keep records of all cancellation requests
- Train staff on exactly how to respond
- Don't make exceptions based on how guests ask

### Handle Disputes Gracefully

When guests push back:

1. **Acknowledge** their frustration
2. **Explain** the policy clearly
3. **Offer** any flexibility that exists (credit, reschedule)
4. **Hold firm** if policy doesn't allow exceptions

**Example response:**
> "I understand the last-minute change is frustrating. Our policy is [X], which we apply consistently to all guests. What I can do is offer you a credit for an off-peak stay within the next 12 months. Would that work for your situation?"

### Document Everything

Keep records of:
- Original booking terms agreed to
- All cancellation requests and outcomes
- Any exceptions made and why
- Guest communication history

This protects you from chargebacks and disputes.

## Measuring Policy Effectiveness

Track these metrics to optimize your policy:

- **Cancellation rate** — Too high? Policy may be too lenient
- **No-show rate** — Deposits reduce these dramatically
- **Booking refusal rate** — Guests turned away may indicate policy is too strict
- **Chargeback rate** — High rates suggest policy gaps
- **Reviews mentioning policy** — Monitor sentiment

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Tiered timeframes** work best: stricter closer to arrival
- **Deposits are essential** for commitment and protection
- **Peak season** deserves stricter terms
- **Modifications** should be easier than cancellations
- **Clear communication** prevents disputes
- **Consistency** is more important than strictness

---

## Conclusion

A great cancellation policy protects your revenue without making guests feel trapped. The best policies are clear, fair, and consistently applied—removing ambiguity for both you and your guests.

Remember: your policy should encourage guests to commit meaningfully while providing reasonable flexibility for genuine circumstances. When guests understand your policy upfront and feel it's fair, they book with confidence.
