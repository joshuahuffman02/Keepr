## Introduction

Well-maintained campsites don't happen by accident. They're the result of systematic schedules, clear responsibilities, and smart planning that balances upkeep needs against booking revenue.

Too often, maintenance is reactive: something breaks, you fix it. But reactive maintenance leads to guest complaints, emergency repairs during peak season, and sites that slowly deteriorate. The alternative—proactive, scheduled maintenance—keeps your campground in top shape while minimizing revenue loss.

This guide covers how to build and execute a maintenance schedule that works.

## Building Your Maintenance Schedule

### Step 1: Inventory Everything

List every asset that needs maintenance:

**Infrastructure:**

- Utility pedestals (count)
- Water hookups and lines
- Sewer/dump station
- Electric systems
- Roads and driveways
- Signage

**Facilities:**

- Restrooms/showers
- Laundry
- Office
- Pavilions
- Pools

**Sites:**

- Fire rings
- Picnic tables
- Site markers
- Landscaping

**Equipment:**

- Mowers
- Utility vehicles
- Cleaning equipment
- Maintenance tools

### Step 2: Determine Frequencies

Assign maintenance intervals to each item:

| Item              | Daily | Weekly | Monthly | Seasonal | Annual |
| ----------------- | :---: | :----: | :-----: | :------: | :----: |
| Restroom cleaning |  Yes  |  Deep  |    —    |    —     |   —    |
| Trash collection  |  Yes  |   —    |    —    |    —     |   —    |
| Mowing            |   —   |  Yes   |    —    |    —     |   —    |
| Road grading      |   —   |   —    |    —    |   Yes    |   —    |
| Electric testing  |   —   | Sample |    —    |   Full   |   —    |
| Tree trimming     |   —   |   —    |    —    |    —     |  Yes   |

### Step 3: Create the Calendar

Map maintenance to your calendar:

**Off-season (November-March):**

- Major projects: electrical upgrades, building repairs
- Tree work while clear visibility
- Equipment servicing
- Winterization tasks

**Pre-season (April-May):**

- De-winterization
- Full utility testing
- Cosmetic touch-ups
- Safety inspections

**Peak season (June-August):**

- Minimize disruption
- Daily/weekly essentials only
- Emergency repairs only
- Note issues for fall

**Shoulder season (September-October):**

- Address accumulated issues
- Prepare for winterization
- Evaluate annual projects

## Site Blocking for Maintenance

### When to Block Sites

You'll need to take sites offline for:

- Utility repairs
- Concrete/pad work
- Tree work near sites
- Deep cleaning (cabins)
- Pest treatment
- Major landscaping

### Strategic Blocking

Minimize revenue impact:

**Block during low demand:**

- Mid-week rather than weekends
- Shoulder season rather than peak
- Consider cancellation/gap situations

**Stagger work:**

- Don't block entire sections at once
- Spread maintenance across multiple weeks
- Maintain capacity for expected bookings

**Plan ahead:**

- Block sites in reservation system in advance
- Prevent bookings during planned work
- Don't scramble to move booked guests

### Emergency Maintenance

When repairs can't wait:

1. Assess urgency and scope
2. Clear affected site(s) if occupied (relocate guests)
3. Communicate timeline
4. Complete work as quickly as possible
5. Document for insurance/records

---

## Maintenance Tracking Systems

### Simple Paper System

For smaller campgrounds:

**Daily checklist:**

- Printed forms for daily tasks
- Staff initials when completed
- Reviewed by manager

**Work requests:**

- Paper forms for issues discovered
- Routed to appropriate person
- Filed when completed

### Digital Tracking

For larger operations or better organization:

**Spreadsheet tracking:**

- Shared Google Sheet or Excel
- Tabs for different task types
- Status columns (pending, in progress, completed)
- Date and assignee tracking

**Dedicated software:**

- Property management software with maintenance module
- Work order systems
- Asset management platforms

### What to Track

Every maintenance record should include:

- What was done (description)
- Where (site/location)
- When (date, time if relevant)
- Who (staff member)
- Materials used (for costing)
- Issue that prompted work (if repair)
- Photos (for significant work)

## Staff Maintenance Responsibilities

### Clear Assignments

Everyone should know their maintenance role:

| Role         | Maintenance Responsibility                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Front Desk   | Report observed issues, cleanliness standards |
| Housekeeping | Restrooms, cabins, common areas               |
| Grounds      | Mowing, landscaping, site prep                |
| Maintenance  | Repairs, utilities, equipment                 |
| Management   | Oversight, scheduling, contractors            |

### Daily Briefings

Start each day with:

- Yesterday's issues needing follow-up
- Today's scheduled maintenance
- Site blocks or limitations
- Expected arrivals/departures affecting access

### Reporting Issues

Staff should immediately report:

- Safety hazards (priority)
- Utility problems
- Guest complaints about conditions
- Equipment malfunctions
- Anything beyond their scope to fix

---

## Preventive Maintenance Schedules

### Monthly Inspections

Create a rotation for systematic checks:

**Week 1:** Utility pedestals (electrical testing, physical condition)
**Week 2:** Water systems (spigots, pressure, lines)
**Week 3:** Restroom facilities (plumbing, fixtures, surfaces)
**Week 4:** Grounds and roads (erosion, drainage, surfaces)

### Seasonal Checklists

**Spring Opening:**

- [ ] Turn on and test all water systems
- [ ] Electrical panel inspection
- [ ] Road assessment after winter
- [ ] Pool opening and inspection
- [ ] Equipment startup and testing
- [ ] Safety walk-through
- [ ] Signage inventory

**Fall Closing:**

- [ ] Winterize water systems
- [ ] Drain outdoor equipment
- [ ] Final mowing and cleanup
- [ ] Gutter cleaning
- [ ] Building weatherization
- [ ] Equipment storage and maintenance
- [ ] Security checks established

---

## Budget Considerations

### Maintenance Allocation

Industry rule of thumb: budget 3-5% of revenue for maintenance.

**Budget categories:**

- Routine supplies (cleaning, basics)
- Repair parts and materials
- Contractor services
- Equipment maintenance
- Capital improvements (separate)

### Tracking Costs

Monitor spending to:

- Forecast future needs
- Identify problem areas
- Plan major purchases
- Justify rate increases

---

## Common Maintenance Mistakes

### 1. Reactive-Only Approach

**Problem:** Wait until things break
**Result:** Guest complaints, higher repair costs, peak-season emergencies

**Solution:** Scheduled preventive maintenance

### 2. Peak Season Disruptions

**Problem:** Major projects during high occupancy
**Result:** Guest complaints, lost revenue, rushed work

**Solution:** Off-season planning for major work

### 3. No Documentation

**Problem:** Work done without records
**Result:** No contractor history, missed recurring issues, no warranty tracking

**Solution:** Simple but consistent tracking

### 4. Over-relying on Single Staff Member

**Problem:** One person knows everything
**Result:** Vulnerability if they leave, bottlenecks

**Solution:** Cross-training, documentation, shared systems

## Key Takeaways

- **Schedule proactively** — Don't wait for things to break
- **Block sites strategically** — Low-demand periods, staggered approach
- **Track everything** — Simple documentation beats memory
- **Assign clearly** — Everyone knows their maintenance role
- **Budget appropriately** — 3-5% of revenue for maintenance

## Conclusion

Effective maintenance is invisible—guests experience a well-kept campground without seeing the work behind it. That invisibility comes from good scheduling, clear responsibilities, and systematic attention to every aspect of your property.

Build your maintenance schedule around your season, track what's done, and address issues before they become guest complaints. Your campground will last longer, guests will be happier, and you'll avoid the crisis mode of reactive repairs.
