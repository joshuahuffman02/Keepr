## Introduction

Extended stay guests—those staying weeks or months rather than days—represent a different kind of business for campgrounds. They provide stable, predictable revenue but come with unique management challenges that differ significantly from transient camper operations.

Whether you're deliberaterly courting long-term guests, accommodating snowbirds, or responding to the growing trend of remote workers living in RVs, understanding how to properly manage extended stays is essential for modern campground operators.

This guide covers everything from pricing and contracts to relationship management and legal considerations.

## Understanding the Extended Stay Market

### Types of Extended Stay Guests

| Guest Type                    | Typical Stay | Characteristics                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Snowbirds                     | 3-6 months   | Retirees escaping cold, same time each year |
| Work Campers                  | Seasonal     | Working at your campground or nearby        |
| Construction Workers          | 1-6 months   | Project-based, may have employer paying     |
| Remote Workers/Digital Nomads | 1-3 months   | Working while traveling, need WiFi          |
| Transition Guests             | Variable     | Between homes, temporary situations         |
| Retirees                      | Year-round   | Lifestyle choice, may be semi-permanent     |

### Why Extended Stays Matter

**Benefits:**

- Predictable, stable monthly revenue
- Lower turnover costs (cleaning, check-in time)
- Sites filled during typically slow periods
- Guest investment in campground community
- Word-of-mouth referrals within their communities

**Challenges:**

- Lower per-night revenue vs. transient guests
- Potential regulatory/zoning issues
- Different service expectations
- Site wear and maintenance
- Balance with transient capacity

## Pricing Extended Stays

### Monthly Rate Structure

Most campgrounds offer significant discounts for longer stays:

| Duration             | Typical Discount | Example Rate                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Weekly (7 nights)    | 10-15%           | Pay for 6, get 7               |
| Monthly (30 nights)  | 30-50%           | Daily $45 → Monthly $800-1,000 |
| Seasonal (3+ months) | 40-60%           | Additional seasonal discount   |

**Calculating your monthly rate:**

```
Nightly rate: $50
Days in month: 30
Full-price monthly: $1,500
Discount target: 40%
Monthly rate: $900

Break-even analysis:
$900/month vs. transient at variable occupancy
At 60% transient occupancy: $50 × 30 × 60% = $900
--> Monthly rate equals transient at 60% occupancy
```

If your off-season transient occupancy is below 60%, monthly guests make financial sense.

### What to Include in Monthly Rates

**Typically included:**

- Site rental
- Standard utilities (water, sewer, electric up to X kWh)
- Basic amenities access

**Often metered or extra:**

- Electricity above baseline (100-300 kWh)
- Cable TV
- WiFi premium tiers
- Storage space
- Additional vehicles

**Example pricing structure:**

```
Monthly Rate: $850
Includes: Site, water, sewer, electric up to 200 kWh
Overages: $0.15/kWh above 200
Add-ons: WiFi premium ($25), storage ($50)
```

## Extended Stay Agreements

### Why Contracts Matter

A handshake agreement for a long-term stay is a recipe for problems. Always use written agreements that cover:

### Essential Contract Elements

**1. Term and Dates**

- Specific start and end dates
- Renewal terms (automatic or re-application?)
- Notice required for early termination (both parties)

**2. Financial Terms**

- Monthly rate
- Due date (1st of month, weekly, etc.)
- Late fees and grace period
- Security deposit amount and conditions
- What's included vs. metered/extra

**3. Rules and Expectations**

- Campground rules apply
- Vehicle and visitor limits
- Site maintenance expectations
- Quiet hours and behavioral standards
- Pet policies

**4. Site Condition**

- Guest's responsibility to maintain site orderly
- What modifications/structures are allowed
- Requirement to remain "mobile"
- Removal of belongings at end

**5. Termination**

- Grounds for immediate termination (violations)
- Process for ending agreement
- Refund/forfeiture of deposit
- Removal of property after termination

### Sample Agreement Sections

**Mobility Clause:**

```
Guest's RV must remain mobile and capable of self-powered
movement at all times. Skirting, permanent decks, or
foundations are not permitted. RV must be moved for
inspection upon 24-hour notice.
```

**Termination Clause:**

```
Either party may terminate this agreement with 30 days
written notice. In cases of rule violations, management
may terminate with 7 days notice. Deposit will be
forfeited for violations or damage.
```

## Managing Extended Stay Guests

### Balancing Long-Term and Transient

**The capacity question:**
What percentage of your sites should be allocated to long-term?

**Factors to consider:**

- Transient demand in your market
- Seasonal fluctuations
- Financial stability goals
- Community feel you want to create
- Physical site layout

**Common approaches:**

- Dedicate specific section to long-term only
- Allow long-term only during off-season
- Set maximum percentage (e.g., 30% of sites)
- Evaluate monthly based on demand forecast

### Setting Expectations

Long-term guests often need clearer communication:

**At move-in:**

- Review all rules and policies
- Introduce to neighbors and staff
- Explain maintenance procedures
- Provide utility usage guidelines
- Clarify what makes this a campground, not a home

**Ongoing:**

- Monthly check-ins (even informal)
- Address issues quickly before they escalate
- Communicate schedule changes (mowing, maintenance)
- Keep them informed about campground events

### Common Extended Stay Issues

| Issue                                 | Prevention                               | Response                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| "Permanence" creep (structures, junk) | Clear rules, periodic inspections        | Written notice, deadline to comply      |
| Rent payment issues                   | Auto-pay encouragement, firm late fees   | Payment plan, or termination if chronic |
| Neighbor conflicts                    | Clear quiet hours, mediation willingness | Meet with both parties, document        |
| Utility abuse                         | Metered pricing above baseline           | Review actual usage, adjust rate/limits |
| Guest becomes "resident"              | Mobility requirement, periodic moves     | Consult attorney on local tenant laws   |

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

### Campground vs. Housing

**Critical distinction:** Extended stay guests must remain "guests," not "tenants."

**Why it matters:**

- Tenants have eviction protection rights
- Campgrounds may lose zoning status if "housing"
- Property tax classification could change
- Different insurance requirements

**Protective measures:**

- Clear short-term language in agreements
- Mobility requirements and enforcement
- No utility account in guest's name
- Periodic site reassignment
- Limit maximum continuous stay
- Consult local regulations and attorney

### Local Regulations

Check with your jurisdiction on:

- Maximum length of stay allowed by zoning
- Mobile home vs. RV park classification
- Health department requirements
- Property tax implications
- Business license requirements

**States vary significantly.** What's acceptable in Arizona may be prohibited in California.

## Creating Community (Without Creating Problems)

### The Social Dynamic

Long-term guests often form tight communities. This can be positive:

- Self-policing and mutual support
- Investment in campground wellbeing
- Social activities and gatherings
- Return year after year

**But can become problematic:**

- Cliques that exclude transient guests
- "We've always done it this way" resistance
- Entitlement to specific sites
- Gossip and interpersonal conflicts

### Best Practices for Long-Term Community

**Maintain your authority:**

- You set the rules, not legacy guests
- New policies apply to everyone
- Don't let "seniority" create special privileges

**Integrate with transient guests:**

- Common areas are for everyone
- Encourage welcoming behavior
- Host events that mix guest types

**Address issues promptly:**

- Don't let conflicts fester
- Document everything
- Apply rules consistently

---

## Seasonal Guest Programs

### Snowbird Season Structure

Many campgrounds formalize extended stay into seasonal programs:

**Pre-season:**

- Open reservations for returning guests first
- Accept new seasonal applications
- Collect deposits to hold sites

**During season:**

- Organized activities for seasonal community
- Communication channels (newsletter, Facebook group)
- Monthly billing or prepaid season rate

**End of season:**

- Site inspection before departure
- Deposit return or rollover
- First right of refusal for next year

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Extended stays provide stable revenue** but require different management approach
- **Written agreements are essential** — never rely on handshakes for monthly guests
- **Pricing should reflect true value** — consider occupancy rates without long-term guests
- **Legal distinctions matter** — keep guests as guests, not tenants
- **Community is an asset** — but you must maintain control and consistency

---

## Conclusion

Extended stay guests can be the foundation of a healthy campground business—especially during slower seasons when transient demand drops. The key is managing them intentionally: with clear contracts, appropriate pricing, consistent expectations, and awareness of the legal landscape.

Done right, long-term guests become your campground's biggest advocates and most reliable revenue source. Done poorly, they become headaches that compromise your flexibility and complicate your operations.
