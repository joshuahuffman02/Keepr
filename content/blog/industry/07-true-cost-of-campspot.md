## Introduction

Campspot is one of the most recognized names in campground software. But when parks ask "what does Campspot cost?", the answer is rarely straightforward.

This article breaks down the real cost of using Campspot, including base fees, per-booking charges, setup costs, and hidden expenses that don't show up until you're already using the platform.

## Understanding Campspot's Pricing Model

Campspot uses a tiered pricing model based on your park's size and features needed. Here's what we've gathered from public sources and industry conversations:

### Base Monthly Fees

| Park Size | Monthly Range |
|-----------|---------------|
| Small (under 50 sites) | $199-299/month |
| Medium (50-150 sites) | $299-449/month |
| Large (150+ sites) | $449-599+/month |

These are estimates based on industry research. Exact pricing varies and Campspot requires contacting sales for quotes.

### Per-Booking Fees

This is where costs add up quickly:

- **Standard:** ~$2.50 per reservation
- **Marketplace bookings:** Additional marketplace fee
- **Some plans:** Per-booking fees can reach $3+

Let's calculate what this means:

| Monthly Bookings | Per-Booking Cost ($2.50) |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| 100 | $250 |
| 200 | $500 |
| 300 | $750 |
| 500 | $1,250 |

A medium park with 200 monthly bookings pays approximately $500/month just in per-booking fees, on top of the base subscription.

### Setup and Onboarding

New Campspot customers typically face:

- **Setup fee:** $1,500-3,000 (varies by park complexity)
- **Data migration:** Often included but time-intensive
- **Training:** May be additional
- **Hardware:** Terminals, printers, etc. (varies)

## Real-World Cost Examples

### Example 1: Small Family Campground

- 60 sites
- 150 bookings/month average
- Basic feature needs

**Monthly costs:**
- Base fee: ~$249/month
- Per-booking ($2.50 x 150): $375/month
- **Total monthly:** ~$624/month = **$7,488/year**

Plus first-year setup: ~$2,000 = **Year 1 total: ~$9,488**

### Example 2: Medium RV Park

- 120 sites
- 300 bookings/month average
- Full feature set

**Monthly costs:**
- Base fee: ~$399/month
- Per-booking ($2.50 x 300): $750/month
- **Total monthly:** ~$1,149/month = **$13,788/year**

Plus first-year setup: ~$2,500 = **Year 1 total: ~$16,288**

### Example 3: Large Resort

- 250 sites
- 600 bookings/month average
- Enterprise features

**Monthly costs:**
- Base fee: ~$549/month

## Hidden Costs to Consider

### 1. The Marketplace Double-Dip

Campspot operates the Campspot Marketplace where travelers search for campgrounds. If bookings come through the Marketplace:

- You pay your normal per-booking fee
- Plus a marketplace referral fee
- Effectively paying twice for the same reservation

If a significant portion of your bookings come through Campspot's Marketplace, this adds up.

### 2. Payment Processing

Credit card processing fees are separate from software fees:

- Typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Passed through to you
- Not always obvious in initial pricing discussions

For a park processing $50,000/month in payments:
- Processing fees: ~$1,480/month
- That's $17,760/year in payment processing alone

### 3. Support Tiers

Basic support is included, but:

- Phone support response times vary
- Priority support may cost extra
- After-hours support limited

If you need hands-on help frequently, investigate what's actually included.

### 4. Contract Terms

Campspot typically requires:

- 1-3 year contracts
- Auto-renewal clauses
- Early termination fees

If your needs change or you want to switch, exiting can be expensive.

### 5. Price Increases

Software prices tend to increase annually. Ask:

- What were prices 2-3 years ago?
- How often do rates increase?
- Are per-booking fees locked or variable?

## What You Get for the Cost

To be fair, let's acknowledge what Campspot provides:

### Strengths

- **Market presence:** Well-known in the industry
- **Marketplace exposure:** Built-in booking source
- **Feature set:** Comprehensive for large operations
- **Integrations:** Many third-party connections
- **Support network:** Established support infrastructure

### Considerations

## Comparison: What Could You Pay Instead?

Let's compare the medium park example (120 sites, 300 bookings/month) across different options:

| Software | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Campspot | ~$1,149 | ~$13,788 |
| Newbook | ~$800-1,000 | ~$9,600-12,000 |
| Keepr | ~$790 | ~$9,480 |
| CampLife | ~$600-800 | ~$7,200-9,600 |

*Note: These are estimates. Actual costs vary by features, negotiations, and specific park needs.*

The differences become more dramatic at higher volumes:

**500 bookings/month:**

| Software | Per-Booking Cost | Monthly Total |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Campspot ($2.50/booking) | $1,250 | ~$1,649+ |
| Keepr ($2.30/booking) | $1,150 | ~$1,250 |
| **Annual difference** | | **~$4,788** |

## Questions to Ask Campspot

If you're evaluating Campspot, get clarity on:

1. **What's my exact total monthly cost** at my current booking volume?
2. **What's the setup fee** and is any of it negotiable?
3. **How have prices changed** over the past 3 years?
4. **What's the contract length** and early termination policy?
5. **What's included in base support** vs. premium support?
6. **How do Marketplace fees work** on top of per-booking fees?
7. **Will my per-booking rate increase** at contract renewal?

## Is Campspot Right for You?

### Campspot may be a fit if:

- You're a larger operation (150+ sites) with budget for premium software
- Marketplace exposure is valuable to you

## Key Takeaways

## Conclusion

Campspot is a capable platform with strong market presence. But capability comes at a cost, and that cost compounds as your bookings grow.

Before signing a multi-year contract, calculate your true total cost at your actual booking volume. Compare that to alternatives. And make sure the premium you're paying delivers premium value.

The best software is the one that fits your operation's needs at a price that makes sense for your business.
