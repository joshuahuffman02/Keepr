## Introduction

Electric vehicles are coming to campgrounds—both as tow vehicles and eventually as RVs themselves. Preparing now positions you for the future.

---

## The EV Landscape

### Current State
- EV adoption accelerating rapidly
- Many campers now drive EVs
- Electric tow vehicles emerging
- All-electric RVs still developing

### What It Means for Campgrounds
- Guests arriving with EVs need charging
- Can be amenity or revenue source
- Infrastructure investment required
- Competitive advantage opportunity

---

## EV Charging Options

### Level 1 (Standard Outlet)
- Regular 120V outlet
- Very slow charging (2-5 miles/hour)
- No special installation
- Useful for overnight "top-up"

### Level 2 (Dedicated Charger)
- 240V, similar to dryer outlet
- Moderate charging (10-30 miles/hour)
- Installation cost: $500-2,000+
- Most practical for campgrounds

### Level 3 (DC Fast Charging)
- Very fast charging (100+ miles/hour)
- High cost: $50,000-100,000+
- Unlikely for most campgrounds
- May be nearby for guests to use

---

## Implementation Approaches

### Option 1: Designated Stations
- Install 1-2 Level 2 chargers
- Shared use, first-come
- May offer free or fee-based

### Option 2: Site-Level
- Add outlets at some/all RV sites
- 50-amp service often works
- Requires adapter (guest provides)

### Option 3: Partnership
- Partner with charging network
- They install and maintain
- Revenue sharing possible

---

## Considerations

**Costs:** Installation, electricity, maintenance
**Demand:** Current guest needs vs. future growth
**Capacity:** Electrical infrastructure limits
**Pricing:** Free amenity vs. per-kWh charge

---

## Key Takeaways

- EV charging is becoming expected
- Start with 1-2 Level 2 chargers
- Can be differentiator and revenue source
- Plan for infrastructure capacity
