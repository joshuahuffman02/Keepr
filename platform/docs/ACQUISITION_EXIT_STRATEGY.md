# Acquisition Exit Strategy
## Keepr - Path to $1M+ Exit

**Goal**: Be acquired by a larger campground management system company for enough to net **$1,000,000+ after taxes**.

---

## The Math

### Tax Considerations
Assuming sale structured as asset sale or stock sale with long-term capital gains:
- Federal capital gains: 15-20%
- State taxes (varies): 0-13%
- Net Investment Income Tax: 3.8% if income > $250K

**Conservative estimate**: ~30% total tax burden

| Net After Tax | Pre-Tax Needed | At 3x Revenue | At 5x Revenue |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| $1,000,000    | $1,430,000     | $477K ARR     | $286K ARR     |
| $1,500,000    | $2,140,000     | $713K ARR     | $428K ARR     |
| $2,000,000    | $2,860,000     | $953K ARR     | $572K ARR     |

**Target**: $300-500K ARR gets you to the $1M+ net zone.

## The Hormozi Angle: Maximizing Exit Value

**"The goal isn't to sell. The goal is to build something so valuable they can't afford NOT to buy."**

### Making an Offer They Can't Refuse

1. **Threaten Their Market Position**
   - Be the "next generation" that makes them look old
   - Win their unhappy customers publicly
   - Be the alternative everyone mentions

2. **Own Something They Need**
   - AI capabilities they can't build fast enough
   - Customer segment they can't reach
   - Technology architecture they wish they had

3. **Create FOMO**
   - Let it leak you're talking to their competitor
   - Build relationships with multiple potential acquirers
   - Never look desperate to sell

### The "Anti-Sell" Positioning

Paradoxically, the best way to get acquired is to act like you never want to be:
- "We're building for the long term"
- "Not interested in selling" (makes them want you more)
- "We're having too much fun disrupting the market"

This creates scarcity and increases perceived value.

## Bottom Line

**To net $1M+ after taxes:**

| Path | Revenue Needed | Timeline | Probability |
|------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| Acqui-hire | Any + strong tech | 12-18 mo | Medium |
| Strategic Sale | ~$300K ARR | 24-30 mo | High if metrics good |
| Competitive Auction | ~$500K ARR | 36+ mo | Highest value |

**Most realistic path**: Build to $25-35K MRR ($300-420K ARR) over 24 months, position as strategic threat to Campspot or acquisition target for Newbook's US expansion.

**The formula**:
```
$1M Net = $1.43M Pre-tax = 4-5x on $300K ARR = ~250 customers at $100/mo
```

This is achievable with the early access program filling all 45 spots and growing from there.
